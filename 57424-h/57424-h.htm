<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This new volume on Germany’s conception and
practice of war is the work of a neutral, a fact which
would alone suffice to secure it our sympathies. Moreover,
it is a book which is systematically arranged,
based on documentary evidence, serious and obviously
sincere, qualities too weighty not to compel the respect
not only of the French public, but of all those, to
whatever nationality they may belong, who may care
to read it or merely to glance through it with an
unprejudiced eye.</p>

<p>The author is a Greek, who loves France and who
knows her. He knows her because he has lived there;
he is not blind to her weak points, but having been
early captured by her, he knows the profound mistake
into which a stranger falls who is content to judge
her by appearances: he has fathomed the depths of
her character and discovered the inexhaustible resources
of will and energy concealed beneath an apparent, yet
much exaggerated, levity. It is for this reason that
in the dread crisis through which she is passing, and
from which, as he well knows, she will emerge victorious,
he has been willing to fight on our side, at least
with the pen. Let us thank him, and may our gratitude
extend beyond him to his noble country, to that
Greece whose feelings have long been known to us,
who has not changed them, notwithstanding the ebb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and flow of her domestic policy or of transitory influences,
and who will not change them, we are
convinced: otherwise she would not be Greece.</p>

<p>So much for the author of these pages which we
are about to read. When I add that M. Léon Maccas
belongs to the best society in Athens: that while still
very young he won the degree of doctor of law in his
own country by a remarkable thesis; that he came to
us with the intention of pursuing further, thanks to
the assistance which we can give him, his studies in
international law and diplomatic history, I shall have
concluded a very inadequate introduction of author
to reader.</p>

<p>As for the contents of this volume, what is the good
of dwelling upon them? It is an established fact, at
the present moment, that the Germans have introduced
into war a new law, a new morality. This law
and this morality are obviously contrary to the ideas
which humanity has hitherto formed of these great
subjects and to the impulses which urged and still urge
humanity to endeavour to mitigate the permissible
sufferings and horrors which war between civilised
nations entails. The Germans have taken quite a
different line. They appear to have made it their
business to practise everywhere, in different forms, the
abuse of force. It is a method, and one, too, which
has something spacious about it. But a method is
something which confesses or proclaims itself. We
do not blush for a method, we blush for an unpremeditated,
precipitate act, not for conduct coldly
calculated with the purpose of attaining a supreme
end, the righteousness of which justifies everything
in the thought of those who aim at it. What is the
meaning, then, of all these shufflings, these denials,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
disputings or flimsy vindications of facts? Why these
shameless apologies among neutrals? Why these
pamphlets, these articles scattered broadcast over two
hemispheres, these idyllic pictures of movements of
German troops to whom the peasants, peasants of
France, express (in a language which betrays clumsy
falsehood) their good wishes for a safe return to their
native land. Why all this effort, if not from the
necessity to justify themselves, a necessity which in
these souls who profess to be emancipated from the
vain prejudices of the world is even stronger and
more deeply rooted than the desire to compel everything
by force? Is not this necessity the clearest and
most invaluable of admissions?</p>

<p>But that is not the whole story. By a contradiction
which would have something grotesque about it if
the tale of bloodshed and destruction made such an
expression permissible, those who every day shamelessly
violate the law of nations are the first to protest
with impassioned vehemence against what in their
opponents they assert to be a violation of the law of
nations, as if the right to trample right under foot
was a privilege of Germany. I am well aware that
on that point also we are critical, but even though
there were some motive for being critical, a thing
which is by no means proven, we must admit that a
nation which has signed certain declarations designed
to mitigate as far as possible the severities of war,
and which, as soon as it becomes belligerent, no longer
holds itself bound by these same declarations, is not
justified in trying to pose as punctilious in the matter.</p>

<p>The only result of all this is hatred, stubborn invincible
hatred, which neither peace nor victory will
destroy. Some Germans, it is said, are beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
be anxious about it; others are getting used to it,
provided that with hate they reap the harvest of
fear; but it is a mistaken calculation, because love,
or, if you like, a minimum of sympathy, is necessary
for the daily round of that common life which we call
international relations. Force, admitting that those
who have it at their disposal can always count upon
it, is powerless to bind nations together, and by force
I understand not merely material force, but a spiritual
force, such as is, for example, science, of which Germany
is so justly proud. If hatred persists, fostered as a
religious duty, kindled in the sacred fire of memory,
there is no security possible for him who is the object
of it: it is the flaw which silently threatens with
sudden destruction the steel upon which so much
reliance is placed.</p>

<p>Woe to the nation which makes itself hated!</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The reader will find in the pages which we herewith
offer him a detailed picture of the cruelties committed
by Germany in the war which involves half the nations
of Europe.</p>

<p>In this war, which she let loose upon the world,
Germany is not attacking merely armies and fortresses.
She takes her victims even from the civil population,
and systematically harries even the property of private
individuals. She revives under our eyes the times of
Attila: to every soldier whom she dispatches against
her enemies she recalls the saying of the Scourge of
God that “wherever he rode there the grass must
cease to grow.” She devotes herself to pillage and
destruction; aye, and to pollution and desecration.
From her captains, her leaders, her diplomats down to
her plain citizens and private soldiers she has disclosed
her barbarous spirit, her base instincts; under
the blazing light of the devouring flames which she
has kindled she lays broad the infamous groundwork
and shameful foundations of what she dares to call
her civilisation, and which, on the plea of its superiority,
she claims to impose upon the whole universe.</p>

<p>Great towns have perished in the flames by her
hands, with all the treasures of science, art and industry
which they contained; innumerable districts, less
populous but no less prosperous, have likewise been
plundered, looted and abandoned to the ravages of
fire and sword; whole regions have been laid waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
without a shadow of military necessity; thousands
of peaceful residents, and harmless citizens of these
areas, priests and women, children and old folk, have
been shot, killed, executed, martyred; women and
young girls have been violated and subjected to the
most frightful tortures; prisoners have been ill-treated
or even shot; the wounded have been dispatched on
the field of battle; young people below the military
age have been carried off to Germany and treated as
prisoners at common law. In the field, the German
armies have been guilty of shameful acts of treachery:
weapons forbidden because they cause horrible wounds
have been used without scruple and without shame.
Towns have had monstrous levies imposed upon them,
which they had to pay on penalty of seeing their
inhabitants massacred. And these things were repeated
everywhere: in Belgium, in France, in Poland,
in Galicia, in Serbia. Fire, sword, bloodshed, dishonour,
slaughter, murder, torture have been flaunted
before the eyes of astonished Europe.</p>

<p>That is the story we are going to tell. And with
the evidence in the case ready to hand, we shall draw
a picture of German barbarism. We shall appeal to
the civilised world and ask it to reflect upon the
monstrous exhibition of the instincts, the character
and the principles of the German nation, which claimed
to be gifted with fine feelings and to be punctilious
about morals. The facts which will be narrated to
the reader will pass judgment upon this claim. In
face of the flattering or mendacious pleas, circulated
for the last fifty years by Germany herself or by her
dupes, this book, the author is fully persuaded, will
but anticipate the verdict of history.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GERMAN THEORY OF WAR</span></h2>

<h3>The Custom of War</h3>

<p>Eternal peace is a chimera. Whatever pains we
may take to avoid war, there always comes a moment
when tradition and interest, passion and affection
clash and bring to pass the shock which we desired
to avoid, a shock which, in the conditions within
which civilisation evolves, appears not merely inevitable,
but salutary. So we see that philosophers and
historians have generally spoken of war as a necessary
evil.</p>

<p>But just because of the services which war is called
upon to render at certain times, it is important not
to keep it apart from all the wholesome, righteous
and moral ideas disseminated by civilisation, some
of which are an age-long gain to society. The evils
which war brings with it must be reduced as much
as possible. A state of war, disastrous in itself, must
be made subject to laws, approved by righteousness
and morality, laws which experience has shown to be
practicable and salutary.</p>

<p>These laws are in effect the international conscience
of civilised nations. They are the laws of humanity.
In every case where military necessity is not absolutely
involved, the nations demand that these laws
should be set in motion. To reduce the enemy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
impotence; to make it impossible for him to resist, is
the aim of belligerents: but to attain that end there
is no need to disown humanity. A war humanely
conducted may be speedily brought to an end. Often,
even, it attains its end more quickly by declining to
exasperate the enemy and by conciliating opinion. On
the other hand, by resorting to terrorism and attacking
the enemy’s dearest, most cherished and most sacred
possessions—the lives of non-combatants, private
property, works of science and art, the good name of
families, religion—you renew his power of resistance,
increase his moral strength, and infuse into him the
spirit of hatred and vengeance.</p>

<h3>German Military Writers’ Theory of War</h3>

<p>German military writers have paid no attention to
that. In the picture which they have drawn of force,
they have left no room for justice and moderation,
which alone make it worthy of respect and bring about
lasting results. The triumph, such as it is, of violence,
bounds their whole horizon. Clausewitz, an author
who has the ear of Germany, writes, “War knows
only one means: force. There is no other: it is
destruction, wounds, death, and this resort to brutal
force is absolutely imperative. As for that right of
nations, about which its advocates talk so much, it
imposes on the purpose and right of war merely
insignificant and, so to speak, negligible, restrictions.
In war every idea of humanity is a blunder, a dangerous
absurdity. The violence and brutality of combat
admit no kind of limitation.”</p>

<p>“Let France reflect upon the words of one who
has been called ‘an immortal teacher,’” says a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
celebrated commentator of the same Clausewitz, Baron
Bronsard de Schellendorf, a former Prussian Minister
of War, in another work (<i>France under Arms</i>). And
this author adds, “If civilised nations do not scalp
the vanquished, do not cut their prisoners’ throats,
do not destroy towns and villages, do not set fire to
farms, do not lay waste everything in their path, it
is not from motives of humanity. No, it is because
it is better policy to ransom the vanquished and to
make use of productive territories.”</p>

<p>The author does not ask himself if, always from this
point of view, no other limitations to the brutalities
of war are imposed upon thoughtful people, limitations
which are in conformity with well-understood
interest, and which at the same time would win the
approbation of righteousness and humanity. Wholly
obsessed by the coarse intoxication of his principle of
absolute violence, he adds—</p>

<p>“The style of old Clausewitz is a feeble affair. He
was a poet who put rosewater into his inkpot. But it
is only with blood that you can write about the things
of war. <i>Besides, the next war will be a terrible business.</i>
Between Germany and France it can only be a question
of a duel to the death. <i>To be or not to be</i>: that
is the question, and one, too, which will only be solved
by the destruction of one of the combatants.”</p>

<p>Such is the tone of German military authors. Their
responsibility is of the highest importance in the story
we have to tell. It is they, it is their principles
disseminated through Germany, which have set up
like a dogma in that country the cult of force in and
for itself, divorced from all the moral elements with
which the thought of civilised people surrounds it.
And, having been taught by such masters, the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
nation can in matters of war only thirst for murder
and violence.</p>

<h3>The German State of Mind on the
Eve of War</h3>

<p>These principles had their full effect as soon as the
Germans thought that war was inevitable.</p>

<p>Do not let us here discuss the excitement which
people naturally feel under such circumstances, nor
the emotions of wild enthusiasm and patriotic hatred
into which the rush of events leads them. If these
emotions lead to excesses, we can neither wonder
nor complain at it. Excess is in the nature of things
and is part and parcel of a system in which material
forces work for a just end—namely, the safety of the
country. The general upheaval which accompanied a
declaration of war cannot fail to rouse the masses
and to lead to extravagant and blustering demonstrations.
Nevertheless, even in that respect, there
are limits which a nation will never exceed, unless it
is being exploited in the interests of the gospel of
frightfulness, unless the love of destruction for its
own sake is the aim of its leaders and its preceptors,
and is the basis of the nation’s conception of war.</p>

<p>That is the case with the Germans. The instincts
of blind violence which men carry naturally within
them and which education alone restrains, had been
so carefully fostered by the Clausewitz and Schellendorf
schools in the mind of the German people that, once
the restraint of peace has been removed, we could
postulate in them the symptoms of the most dangerous
impulses: symptoms which, in the eyes of every
impartial judge, appeared like the dismal omens of
an appalling thirst for blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The correspondent of the <i>Hovedstaden</i> (<i>La Capitale</i>),
a Danish journal, tells that he heard some women at
Berlin uttering impassioned speeches, shouting that an
attempt was being made to annihilate Germany, and
urging the men to the task of destruction by fire and
sword in the foreign countries to which they were
going. This same correspondent records the fact that
“men and women speakers followed one another in
the Café Piccadilly belching out curses against Great
Britain and her allies.” Such were the feelings of the
public in Germany, different, one might say, from what
one would naturally expect to find in such a case,
for, is it human for a woman to urge on her husband,
her father or her son to a work of cruel destruction?
How effective must have been the doctrines disseminated
by German authors like those we have quoted,
if they have been able, as they have been, to destroy
absolutely the finer feelings even of women, and if
the thirst for violence has led women to make public
attempts to incite their men-folk?</p>

<h3>The State of Mind of German Intellectuals</h3>

<p>But let us leave the military writers, and speak of
men whose peaceful profession ought to have the
effect of inspiring in them feelings of moderation.
The classes whom we call the intellectuals have been
the most savage of all.</p>

<p>“We are barbarians!” wrote the famous German
journalist, Maximilian Harden, in his paper <i>Die
Zukunft</i>, at the beginning of the war. “England is
in alliance with yellow apes and rejoices to hear it
said that Germans have been murdered by drunken
Cossacks. The English, the Belgians, the French, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
northern and southern Sklavs and the Japanese
cannot praise one another enough, declaring that
they are the guardians and purveyors of the most
refined civilisation, and calling us barbarians.</p>

<p>“We should be quite wrong to contradict them.
For ancient Rome when it was sick unto death, the
Germans who dug its grave were barbarians. Your
civilisation, friends, wafts to you no fine perfumes!
Accustom yourselves to the idea that on German soil
live barbarians and warriors who for the moment have
no time to talk soft nothings. They shall defeat your
armies, overpower your general staffs, and cut your
tentacles in the oceans. When Tangiers and Toulon,
Antwerp and Calais are subject to barbaric power,
then sometime we shall have a kindly chat with you.”</p>

<p>It is in this state of mind, the mark of unbridled
violence, that the German people embarked on the
war of 1914. A monstrous outburst followed, the
desire and the firm expectation of victory, of which
German patriotism had perhaps the right to be glad.
But at the same time the most brutal and savage
instincts of mankind were let loose.</p>

<p>The will to ravage, destroy, pollute everything
belonging to the enemy filled the German armies, and
the results of teachings printed in books could be seen
written in letters of blood and fire on the page of
history. The theory of blind violence openly professed
in Germany for half a century, a theory
which has been drilled into the very soul of the
nation, and has become a principle of conduct for
the individual, has borne its fruit. We shall tell the
story of them.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">GERMAN ACTIONS CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED ON THE PLEA
OF REPRISALS</span></h2>

<h3>The Plea of Reprisals</h3>

<p>Violations of the law of nations and, still more,
acts of cruelty committed in war, have almost always
escaped punishment properly so called. The victim
usually finds himself powerless to exact retribution
for them. Only one course is permitted to him: that
of reprisals, by which he counters acts of violence with
other acts of violence. His aim, therefore, is not
vengeance: the point is to compel the enemy to keep
to what is permissible, through fear of penalties to
which he will be exposed if he persists in wrongdoing.
Reprisals may frequently involve great violence, but
one rule is universally admitted—that they never
justify acts of cruelty properly so called. Amongst
the latter are the massacre of women and children,
mutilation, cunningly devised torture, etc. Two other
principles are likewise admitted as regards reprisals,
to wit—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) that the severity of reprisals must not be
out of proportion to the gravity of the offence.</p>

<p>(2) that in cases where the offence has been
committed by individual non-combatants, reprisals
must not be inflicted on their fellow-citizens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
as the aggrieved army has its legitimate
remedy under what is called martial law. Now
the Germans have violated this rule and these
principles.</p>

</div>

<h3>Reprisals and the Germans</h3>

<p>On many occasions the Germans have had recourse
to the plea of reprisals to justify acts of violence committed
by them. We shall show that this plea is a
misuse of terms. One of the excuses which they have
most frequently put forward is that civilians have
taken part in the war, in Belgium, in France, in Poland.
But the question of the civilian population taking
part in military operations is bound up with the question
of francs-tireurs, which Germany wanted to solve
to suit herself and which will occupy our attention
later on. Let us here point out one thing—that the
circumstances under which, even according to the
German version of events, civilians have taken part
in the war, are very often quite enough to condemn
Germany. For example, Herr de Bethmann-Hollweg,
the Imperial Chancellor, thought he could persuade the
whole world of the innocence of the German soldiers,
whose admitted excesses, so far as Louvain was concerned,
were due, he said, to the fact that the young
girls of the town had gouged out the eyes of the German
soldiers. Let us assume the Chancellor’s good faith
in making such a statement. Assuredly he cannot
have supposed that this happened in many instances
or that it went so far as a general execution. It can
only have been reported to him, and he can only have
been induced to believe it as an exceptional act. It
is not of the nature of such an act, alike from the
cruelty which it assumes in women and from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
difficulty of carrying it out, to be repeated often, and
this is the reason for destroying a town, burning
Louvain and pillaging the whole country. “A plea
of self-defence like this,” said M. Hanotaux, “by
itself gives you a picture of the German soul.”</p>

<h3>German Slanders which Attempt to Disguise
Cruel Acts of the Imperial Troops
as Reprisals</h3>

<p>All the other excuses of the Germans are of the
same kind. Their very weakness proves that they
are slanders. For example, Germany has endeavoured
to spread in foreign countries, and especially in
Switzerland, a rumour to the effect that people on their
way back from enemy countries who had stopped in
France, and also Swiss subjects, had been ill-treated
by the French authorities. The object of this grotesque
report was obviously to forestall charges under the
same heading which would fall on Germany, and to
prepare the public opinion of the world to think that
charges outstanding against them were cancelled by
the necessity of resorting to reprisals for acts committed
in France. The Swiss newspapers did not fail
to denounce the German manœuvre. To show the
extent to which the policy of lying was being carried,
the <i>Journal de Genève</i> published a letter from the
Swiss Consul at Besançon, giving the highest praise
to the manner in which Germans and Austrians had
been treated in France.</p>

<p>Moreover, of what value can these slanders be when,
on the other hand, documentary evidence proves that
the French authorities have behaved to the Germans
with an excess of indulgence. It is certain, at least,
that nowhere in France has any hatred been shown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the prisoners. Even prisoners of war have been most
energetically protected by the heads of the army
against the passions of crowds. On this head here is
a note which a French general, Commandant at Angers,
addressed to the newspapers of this town—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For some days convoys of prisoners of war have
been passing through the Angers railway station.</p>

<p>“Part of the civil population, and not always the
best part, crowds on the bridge above the station and
utter cries when they think they recognise an enemy
uniform on the platform. These demonstrations are
unbecoming; if the Germans behave like brutes to
their prisoners, there is no reason why we should
imitate them. A nation like France, which boasts
with good right of being the most civilised of all, cannot,
by acting like them, follow in the footsteps of the
barbarians whom we are on the way to conquer at
our will and pleasure, with arms in our hands. I beg,
therefore, the staff of the local press to be good enough
to invite civilians to maintain the calmness and dignity
which are the qualities of strong races, conscious of
their place in civilisation.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Général d’Ormesson.</span>”</p>

</div>

<h3>Trivial Acts have sometimes been the Cause of
Terrible Reprisals</h3>

<p>One of the manœuvres practised by the Germans
consists in their firing some gunshots themselves,
at the moment when they were entering a village
evacuated by enemy troops, and pretending that these
shots came from civilians. Consequently they began
to resort to what they called reprisals. All the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
did they resort to them when the smallest actual
offence gave them any pretext.</p>

<p>In his book, <i>German Evidence for German Crimes</i>,
M. Bédier tells how at Orchies “a woman was shot
for not having obeyed the word of command to halt.
The result, the whole district burnt!” The disobedience
of this peasant woman was considered by
the German, Major Mehring, the Commandant at
Valenciennes, a “terrible atrocity.” In the belief
that other equally terrible atrocities had been, according
to report, committed at Orchies this Major decided
on the destruction of the town. Moreover, he was
extraordinarily proud of it, for he issued a proclamation
saying that “unfortunately” he had been compelled
to the most rigorous measures of martial law against
the town of Orchies. “In this locality,” he adds,
“the most terrible atrocities were committed. I have
drawn the due inferences therefrom, and have destroyed
the whole town. <i>The old town of Orchies, a town of
5000 inhabitants, is no more …</i> The dwelling-houses,
town hall and church are annihilated.” As a matter
of fact the Germans directed a furious bombardment
against Orchies; incendiary bombs, benzine sprinklers,
every means was employed. For a radius of six
leagues the red lights of the conflagration could be
seen rising.</p>

<h3>In Poland</h3>

<p>A circumstance quite as trivial as the disobedience
of the Orchies peasant woman was the occasion for
the monstrous acts of cruelty and extortion of which
the Germans were guilty at Kalich, in Poland. In
that place, because some one threw a stone at a patrol,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Lieutenant-colonel Prenster, in command of the
garrison, caused all the residents in one house to be
shot, and then, thinking that that was not enough,
he had all the people who lived in Rue Vroclavska
brought out of their houses and riddled with grapeshot.
About a hundred were killed. Another inhabitant of
Kalich, Sokolof, the treasurer, was shot “for having
burnt, the evening before the Germans entered, the
banknotes in the departmental bank.” Another,
named Dernbourg, was hanged on the mere charge of
having “carried a lantern in his hand.” This fact
proved him to have been a spy! The truth is that
the unfortunate man had used the lantern only for
the purpose of carrying out certain necessary repairs
to his mill. Four workmen engaged in the mill were
also put to death, after some forms of trial. Four
hundred houses were destroyed in this town, representing
a loss of sixty million roubles. The leader of
the Germans in this performance was an individual
of German extraction, Michel by name, the former
head of a brothel at Kalich, whom the German
Commandant appointed mayor of the town.</p>

<h3>The Germans Admit that their Pleas of Defence
are a Sham</h3>

<p>The Germans have been trained in a rigorous school,
but they are lacking in flexibility of mind. Moreover,
they were unable to avoid admissions which confute
their falsehoods.</p>

<p>So it happened that when the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>
recorded acts of cruelty which it alleged had been
committed by the Allies, a refutation of its charges
came from Germany itself. This paper told that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
France cigars and cigarettes filled with powder were
given to German prisoners: <i>Vorwaerts</i> took up the
task of replying to this piece of stupidity, showed that
a great number of stories of the same kind had been
admitted to be false, and that in particular the story
of the cigarettes was a mere invention. The legend
that German soldiers had had their eyes gouged out
by francs-tireurs was also denounced as a mere imagination.
On this point <i>Vorwaerts</i> wrote: “No proof has
been made out on official authority that German
soldiers have had their eyes gouged out by francs-tireurs.
A certain well-known Berlin newspaper declared
that there were at the Grosslichterfeld hospital
ten slightly wounded soldiers, who had had their eyes
gouged out by the enemy. When Herr Liebknecht
asked the superintendent of the hospital if the report
was correct, the latter replied, ‘Fortunately, these
rumours are devoid of all foundation.’”</p>

<p><i>Vorwaerts</i> recurred to this same question on the
6th December, 1914, when it published the results
of an inquiry made of the management of the
Hanover hospitals and the grand charity hospital at
Berlin.</p>

<p>The management of the Hanover hospitals addressed
the following reply to the Socialist journal. “As a
result of inquiry made among the doctors of the
different sections of hospital 3, we are able to inform
you that we have not at present at the hospital a
single wounded person whose eyes have been gouged
out. We have never had one.”</p>

<p>Similarly, the management of the charity hospital
at Berlin communicated the following note to <i>Vorwaerts</i>:
“The charity hospital has admitted no wounded who
have had their eyes gouged out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, the great Catholic newspaper, the <i>Kölnische
Volkszeitung</i>, having published in the month of
November an article in which the same legend reappeared,
Arch-presbyter Kaufmann had a conclusive
document inserted in this paper.</p>

<p>A doctor, M. Saethre, who said he had visited the
Cologne hospitals, had written, “There can be no doubt
about the atrocities committed by francs-tireurs. I
myself saw at Aix-la-Chapelle a Red Cross sister
whose breast had been cut off by francs-tireurs, and
a Major whose eyes had been gouged out whilst he
lay on the field of battle.” He replied, under date
26th November, in a letter to the paper from which
we make this extract: “You asked me to write to
you what I thought about this report. I, therefore,
applied to the competent military authorities to know
if the statements made by Doctor Saethre were correct.
The superintendent of the hospital writes me under
date 25th November, ‘The atrocities of which you
tell me have not been committed, at least as far as
Aix-la-Chapelle is concerned. We have not seen
the Red Cross sister referred to nor the Major
either.’</p>

<p>“I do not know,” continued the Arch-presbyter,
where the doctor of whom the <i>Kölnische Volkszeitung</i>
speaks has got his information. “I think it necessary
to state here again that in the hospitals of Aix-la-Chapelle
there is not a single wounded man to be
found whose eyes have been gouged out, and no
Red Cross sister who has suffered the above-mentioned
mutilation.”</p>

<p>In this way was the device foiled. The attempts
made to disguise the German crimes as reprisals led
to nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<h3>Reprisals among the Allies</h3>

<p>These took place on account of the treatment of
German prisoners of war after their internment.
Even on this question complete equality has not yet
been reached, as the Allies did not desire to treat their
prisoners in the least like Germany treats hers.</p>

<p>In their behaviour towards civilians the Allies have
always confined themselves to the limits prescribed
by martial law, without having recourse to the right
of reprisals. In Alsace, German immigrants very
nearly gave occasion for reprisals.</p>

<p>At Cernay, a French section which had deployed
lost thirty-eight men, who had all been struck in the
back; the shots had been fired in the town, before any
German soldier could have reached there. At Lutran,
the German teacher fired on a cavalry patrol and killed
two horses. This attitude of the Germans of Alsace,
as well as the numerous arrests of German spies caught
red-handed in the course of operations in Upper Alsace,
brought several persons before a court-martial. In
these citations the procedure of war was scrupulously
observed. This was particularly the case with the
Mayor and the comptroller of the post office of
Thann, as also with the wife of a German forester of
Schlierbach, who was condemned to death by the
court-martial for having led several soldiers into an
ambuscade.</p>

<p>Only on one occasion did the French speak of
reprisals and threaten to carry them out. This threat
was delivered by aeroplanes, which threw down
proclamations declaring “We have many hostages
in our hands. For every Alsatian killed, we shall
kill ten Germans; for every Alsatian wounded, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
shall kill a German.” The object was to protect
Alsatian civilians, who had fallen into the hands of
the Germans again, against the vengeance of the
latter.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>To sum up, while the Allies, in face of the cruelties
committed by their enemies, waived or restricted their
right of reprisals; the Germans, on the contrary, not
only exercised it, but boldly exceeded it, using it as
a random excuse to justify a policy of vengeance and
terrorisation. Acts of little importance were repressed
by them like outrages. The doings of a single individual
brought about the ruin of a village. Still
more, these doings were invented to justify gratuitous
excesses practised for the mere purpose of terrorisation.
These general remarks were necessary before
embarking on the story of the excesses and crimes
which Germany wished to dispute and the details of
which we are about to read.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GERMAN TREATMENT OF OFFICIALS</span></h2>

<h3>German Violence</h3>

<p>German violence, once it had been let loose by the
declaration of war, forthwith became lost to restraint
of every kind. It was not merely in pitched battles
and amongst soldiers that it was displayed, but behind
the lines, and in matters commonly supposed to be
subject to diplomatic regulations. The official representatives
of foreign countries had to suffer the consequences.
By their conduct towards these distinguished
people, German ministers and officials by
their deliberate action proved to the civilised world
that Germany is the land of cruelty no less than of
insolence and rudeness. The ambassadors, consuls,
etc., of the powers on which Germany had just declared
war were exposed to infamous treatment, perhaps, in
its way, worse than the acts of cruelty committed by
the heads of the army and by the soldiers. Even
people of royal blood, members of the Imperial family
of Russia, were the victims of these outbursts of
violence.</p>

<p>In making this statement we must not exonerate
any section of the German people. The members of
the Government, no less than officials, are responsible,
for none of the latter were censured, and this responsibility
must be traced back to the Emperor. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
other hand, the German people, without distinction of
class, deliberately associated themselves with these
outbursts.</p>

<h3>How the German Authorities behaved to the
Dowager Empress of Russia</h3>

<p>The Dowager Empress of Russia, Marie Feodorovna,
mother of the Emperor of Russia and sister of Queen
Alexandra of England, was travelling through Germany
on the day after the declaration of war. She had just
left England and was going back to Russia.</p>

<p>On the order of the German authorities—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) Her Majesty was stopped at Berlin, where
she was forbidden to continue her journey to
Petrograd to meet her family.</p>

<p>(2) She was given the choice of going to Copenhagen
or of returning to London.</p>

</div>

<p>The Dowager Empress had to obey. She went to
Copenhagen and thence continued her journey.</p>

<h3>How the German Authorities behaved to the
Grand Duke Constantin of Russia
and his Family</h3>

<p>The Grand Duke Constantin Constantinovitch,
grandson of Nicholas I, known as a patron of arts
and letters, who was at the baths of Wildungen, in
Germany, with his family, when war broke out, was
stopped two days after the Empress. At first the
Germans thought of detaining him and making him
prisoner, as they had done with Admiral Skridlof,
formerly Admiral-in-Chief of the Russian Black Sea
fleet, and several Russian generals who likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
happened to be in German territory. But they
merely shut him up with his family in a carriage of a
frontier train. In this carriage they made a point of
putting some soldiers who were travelling pipe in
mouth, and forbade any one to open the windows.
At different stages in the journey the authorities were
guilty of repeated acts of rudeness to the Prince, and
even went so far as to jeer at his suite. When the
Grand Duchess expressed a wish to send a telegram to
the Empress of Germany, who had been her friend
from childhood, she found that she was arrogantly
refused.</p>

<p>From the station at Gumbinnen up to the Russian
frontier, that is to say for a distance of three leagues,
the Grand Duke and his family had to complete the
journey on foot.</p>

<h3>How the Germans behaved to the Ambassador of
France at Berlin</h3>

<p>The German authorities behaved in similar fashion
to M. Jules Cambon, the Ambassador of France at
Berlin. When, armed with his passports, he asked
to leave by way of Holland, the minister refused his
request and sent him word by M. de Lancken, a former
adviser to the German Embassy at Paris, that he would
have to return to France through Austria.</p>

<p>“We should not recommend you,” he said, “to go
through Denmark. The sea may not be safe…”
M. Cambon then asked for himself and his staff a safe-conduct
which would guarantee his journey through
Austria, where his official position would be no protection
to him. This safe-conduct was promised him.
On the following morning this order was countermanded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and M. Cambon was informed that he would
be brought back again to the Danish frontier. Whether
the sea would be safe or not was no longer taken into
consideration. His departure took place the same day.
It took no less than twenty-four hours to cross the
400 kilometres which separate Berlin from Denmark.
When the train got near the frontier all the blinds were
lowered, and soldiers armed with revolvers beset the
doors of each compartment. The passengers were
warned that these soldiers would fire if they left the
carriage, if they put their hands in their pockets, or
if they attempted to touch their luggage.</p>

<p>When they were close to the frontier, a military
official, Commandant de Rheinhaben, came, shamefacedly
enough, and asked M. Cambon for the cost of
the train by which he had travelled from Berlin.
The ambassador offered a cheque on the Bleichroeder
Bank, which was declined. The total expense, which
amounted to 3600 marks, was demanded in gold. The
Embassy staff was able to scrape together this sum.
The passengers then continued their journey, with
the addition to their party of a curious-looking person
who, the Commandant said, was a Scandinavian
merchant. M. Cambon and his companions met this
curious merchant again at Copenhagen and in Norway
at the time of their embarkation for England.</p>

<p>Moreover, as they were going through the Kiel
Canal, the Germans went so far as to claim the right
to search the ambassador’s luggage. And though,
through the interposition of an official, he was spared
this humiliation, soldiers forced themselves into the
carriages and stood on guard facing the passengers,
with their hands on the trigger of their revolvers;
even women and children did not escape this kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
treatment and were threatened with death if they
made the slightest movement.</p>

<h3>How the German Authorities behaved to other
Members of the Diplomatic Corps</h3>

<p>The French Minister at Munich and his family were
notified on the 3rd August, at 6 p.m., that they must
take train the following morning for Constance, under
the supervision of an officer and a Bavarian official.
The Minister asked for an extension of time, which
was refused in accordance with instructions which he
was told had been received from Berlin. On the other
hand, the owners of the premises used as offices and
residences by the legation demanded, under threat of
distress, immediate payment for the current quarter.</p>

<p>M. de Nélidof, the Russian Envoy at the Vatican,
who was returning to Russia through Germany with
his wife, was kept prisoner for two days in the Munich
railway station, where he and Mme. de Nélidof had to
submit to the worst possible treatment at the hands
of soldiers.</p>

<p>The Russian Minister at Dresden was ordered to
leave at nine hours’ notice. With great difficulty he
had the time extended to twenty-four hours. He
and his staff were put into a carriage with blinds
drawn, and he was kept under observation by two
police officials all the way to Munich.</p>

<h3>Brutal Behaviour, which was Permitted by the
German Police, of the Mob, to the Diplomatic
Representatives of Foreign Countries</h3>

<p>We cannot be surprised that the mob shows little
self-control in circumstances so critical as a declaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of war. But what cannot be permitted is that mob
violence should be let loose, and not be forbidden by
the authorities, upon the representatives of foreign
powers, whose mission under such circumstances
automatically comes to an end. In Germany, on
certain occasions, the authorities were actually accomplices
of the mob. This was the case as regards the
treatment of the French and Russian diplomatic body
as they were leaving Berlin.</p>

<p>When the French diplomatic body was passing
through Neumunster, near Kiel, violent demonstrations
were made by a party of ladies of the German
Red Cross. These ladies crowded round the carriage
in which were the staff of the French Embassy, shouting
and shaking their fists. As a glass of water was being
brought to a little girl of three years old, who was
travelling with the Embassy, these ladies took hold of
it and threw it to the ground. In some cases the
behaviour of the crowd was so shameful that Commandant
de Rheinhaben, who had been instructed
to travel with the Embassy, said that in all his life
he had never had so painful a duty to perform.</p>

<p>The demonstrations against the Russian diplomatic
body began on the 27th July, according to a subsequent
statement of M. de Sverbeef, Russian Ambassador to
Berlin, to one of the editors of <i>Novoïé Vrémia</i>, 29th
August, 1914. A howling mob, he said, filled all the
streets round the Embassy, shouting insults to the
Russians. This lasted till two o’clock in the morning.
These demonstrations began again the following day,
but, curious to relate, were at first aimed at Russia
and not at France. At the beginning of the war
it was supposed at Berlin that France would not
participate in the struggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“I left Berlin,” continued the ambassador, “with
the staff of the Embassy on Sunday, 2nd August, at
noon. A mob had gathered in front of the Embassy
in the morning. To avoid unpleasantness, the gate
had been shut. It was only opened at the moment
when we were getting into a motor. I went in front
in the motor of the United States Ambassador. The
crowd did not attack me and I heard hardly any hostile
cries. On the other hand, the mob indulged in
murderous attacks on the other motors.</p>

<p>“Although at Berlin the fact of these murderous
attacks on the members of the Russian Embassy is
denied, they are nevertheless authentic. The mob
wounded not only the men, but also the ladies. It
was not merely the proletariat who gave themselves
up to these acts of violence, but people who appeared
to be quite of high position participated.”</p>

<p>Moreover, several official representatives of Russia
were arrested in the street, but were set at liberty again
when their papers had been examined.</p>

<p>Crapovitzki, the Chamberlain, formerly Secretary-in-Chief
of the Russian Embassy at Berlin, was struck
on the head by blows so violent that his blood saturated
two handkerchiefs, and he had to put himself under
medical care at Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Princess Belosselska, an American citizen, was struck
on the back, on the shoulder, and on the head, by a
well-clad man with a white beard, and some people
spat in her face.</p>

<p>Several other people were ill-treated, especially
Countess Litke, wife of the Russian Minister at Stuttgart;
Mme. Todleben, wife of the Russian Minister
at Carlsruhe; Mmes. Plantine and Raevska; MM.
Diacre and Chapelle of the Embassy at Berlin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and M. Lopaiko. The children were stowed away
on the floor of the motors to protect them from
blows.</p>

<h3>How the German Authorities behaved to Members
of the Consular Service</h3>

<p>Members of the Russian, French and English
consular service in Germany were to have still less
favour shown to them than ambassadors and ministers.
The Consul-General of Russia at Leipzig was unexpectedly
summoned to the police station. He was
there allowed thirty-five minutes to go to the station
and take the train. His vice-consul, who was of a
lower rank, was allowed only ten minutes, and his
pockets were searched to boot.</p>

<p>The Consul-General of France at Frankfurt got
orders to go on the 4th August, and he immediately
obeyed. The German authorities conducted him
to the Belgian frontier, then on the way they changed
their minds and conducted him to Constance. When
he reached the station at Offensburg he was arrested
by an officer. With the consular staff he remained
shut up for five hours in the waiting-room, closely
watched. Then he was conducted, with about one
hundred French people, men, women and children,
who had left Frankfurt at the same time as their
consul-general, to Donaueschingen. There they were
all led under escort in a pelting rain to the other end
of the town into an open station, where their only
opportunity of rest was upon some bundles of straw.
On the next morning it was announced that the French,
with their wives and children, would be detained by
the local authorities. A protest by the consul-general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was ineffective. The consul and his staff were unable
to resume their journey to Constance until 5 o’clock.</p>

<p>On the 5th August the German authorities ordered
the consuls of France, Russia and England to leave
Danzig within an hour.</p>

<p>The three consuls and their families were brought to
Bentheim, on the Dutch frontier, amid insults and ill-treatment
and without being allowed to take any food.
On the 8th August, at Bentheim, the three consuls
were separated from their wives and families, and
shut up in a prison cell, with the sons of the English
consul and M. Vassel, of the French Consulate at
Prague.</p>

<p>They were treated like criminals: they had bread
and water for food, straw mattresses and a stone floor
for bed; they were compelled to clean their cells,
to take a regular walk of half an hour within the
prison precincts, in the company of men who had been
convicted at common law.</p>

<p>The French consul, M. Michel, being ill, asked for
a doctor, but was unable to get one. The superintendent
of the prison thought he had done all that
was required by giving him some castor oil. This
regimen lasted several days. Finally, on the 13th
August, the English consul was released and met again
his wife and his children, who, unknown to him, had
been shut up in another cell. The other consuls were
not set at liberty until some days afterwards.</p>

<p>M. de France de Tersant, Vice-Consul of France at
Frankfurt on the Main, took thirty-three hours to
traverse the 300 kilometres between Frankfurt and
the frontier. He underwent the same annoyances:
tedious confinement in railway stations, perpetual
change of route; he was compelled to travel with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
blinds drawn and windows shut in a stifling heat, in
the company of an armed official.</p>

<p>The wife of this consul, Mme. de France de Tersant,
who left Germany on the 31st July—that is, before
the declaration of war, was arrested at Metz and her
luggage confiscated. In vain she made application
to the military authorities. They refused to receive
it and threatened to keep her in custody. However,
she obtained permission to continue her journey by
horse carriage to Novéant. As she was leaving the
soldiers hooted her. At Novéant the driver refused
to bring her any further. Then she had to go on foot
as far as Pagny-on-the-Moselle, which is the first
French village. A peasant at Novéant lent her a wheelbarrow,
in which she could put her young child. The
peasant consented to push the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>M. Damier, Russian consul at Frankfurt, was
brought by force from his house to a statue of Germania
which he was compelled to salute. A howling
mob kicked him and struck him with their fists.
M. Alberic Néton, Consul-General of France at Düsseldorf,
was ordered on the 2nd August by the Chief of
Police to leave the town at once. Two officials were
stationed before his door with orders not to leave
it. On the next day, on his way to the consulate, he
could not give them the slip. All the day they kept
near him whether he went on foot or rode.</p>

<p>After interminable negotiations with regard to his
departure, the Consul-General of France finally left
Düsseldorf on the 5th August, bringing with him only
a small portmanteau. The destination of the train
was the Dutch frontier (Roermont). But at the first
station, which is Neuss, an officer in a uniform trimmed
with lace came and opened the compartment in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
were the consul-general and many other passengers, and
informed them that the Dutch line was cut and that they
would have to go to Cologne and then to Switzerland.</p>

<p>He had to go to Cologne in a train full of soldiers
and in a third-class carriage. During the whole
journey the soldiers never ceased to make insulting
remarks about France.</p>

<p>At Cologne, the consul-general’s journey was
interrupted by the military authorities. He underwent
a regular search and had to undress to allow
these people to search every bit of his clothing. As
he complained of having to submit to such treatment,
the German officer said to him, “You will see many
other people in the same case as yourself.”</p>

<p>And, in fact, when the search was completed he
was brought, carefully escorted, to an hotel of the
lowest class, an <i>annexe</i> of the Prefecture of Police,
where police officers searched his luggage. M. Néton
was kept there three days under police supervision.
He was forbidden to communicate with any one outside
or to read the newspapers.</p>

<p>“During the third night of our detention,” says the
consul-general in his official report of the 10th August,
“on Friday, 7th August, a little before midnight,
there was a violent knocking at the door of my room.
‘Everybody get up,’ cried a voice; ‘you will be off to
Holland in ten minutes.’ Everybody dressed in great
haste. We were compelled to get into two military
motors, which brought us with all speed to the station.
There we were brought to a train which was standing
ready, and pushed into a carriage where we were
locked in and all the blinds lowered. The signal for
departure was given, but none of us knew where we
were going.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“At six o’clock in the morning the train stopped.
We had just passed Clèves and we were a short distance
from the Dutch frontier. To get us over the remaining
thirty kilometres the mayor of the place, who had
been notified of our arrival, offered to have us driven
across in a light trap.</p>

<p>“When we got down from the carriage he demanded
of us 14 marks, <i>i.e.</i> about 18 francs.</p>

<p>“We were at Vyler, the last Prussian station from
which the boundary, marking the frontier, could be
seen; we thought we were at the end of our troubles,
but we had reckoned without the station officer. ‘Your
papers,’ said he. Each of us showed what the official
who searched us at Cologne had left us. ‘Not in
order,’ he declared. ‘I shall have to report the matter.
In the meantime you must be searched,’ and for a
second time, men and women, we were obliged to undress
completely and to undergo a more minute search
than one could possibly imagine. They even looked
between our toes. The brims of our hats were turned
back. The insoles of our shoes were lifted up. My
watch was opened and the glass of it broken.</p>

<p>“Once more I protested. Police officers, revolver
in belt and rifle in hand, surrounded me and commanded
me to keep silent. The official came towards me. My
last papers and documents were seized and even my
private letters were taken…</p>

<p>“The official took leave of me, saying, ‘I shall return
all this to you at Düsseldorf when you come back.’</p>

<p>“After a few more minutes waiting we were allowed
to cross the frontier. We were free. On my arrival
in Holland I noticed that the soldiers who had searched
me had taken 90 marks in gold which happened to be
in my pocket.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>M. René d’Hennezel, French Vice-Consul at Mannheim,
left his post under similar circumstances. At
Immendigen a non-commissioned officer and four
men burst into his carriage. He examined M.
d’Hennezel’s passports and those of M. Lancial, diplomatic
attaché, had their luggage carefully searched,
and passed on to them the word to follow him to the
captain. On the platform the crowd shouted angrily
and the non-commissioned officer sneered at them.</p>

<p>The captain questioned them fiercely and declared
that their passports were not in order. He prevented
them leaving and had them brought back to the
station-master’s office, where a fresh examination of
their luggage was made in his presence. Finally, he
consented to let them travel by Constance, saying,
“Above all things, mind what you are about, and take
very good care that I hear no complaint of you, or
you will immediately be shot. You must get into the
luggage van.”</p>

<p>M. Armez, French Consul at Stuttgart, during the
last days of his stay received all his correspondence
“unsealed as a military safeguard.”</p>

<p>On the 3rd August he was ordered to leave his post
within three hours, and to bring only hand luggage.
He was stopped at the first station as a spy, and
threatened with death by the other passengers, in the
presence of a menacing crowd. It was only after
many anxieties of every kind and not without having
received several blows and even having been wounded,
that he succeeded in reaching Constance in Swiss
territory.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">OUTRAGES COMMITTED BY GERMAN AUTHORITIES AND
PRIVATE PERSONS AGAINST ENEMY SUBJECTS</span></h2>

<p>The most celebrated German writers on international
law, Heffter, Klueber, Geffcken, have taught
that the State which declares war can neither keep
enemy subjects who happen to be on its territory
nor their property, for as they came into this territory
in reliance upon public law and have received permission
to stay there, they can avail themselves of
the tacit promise made by the State that every freedom
and safety are guaranteed them for their return.
If the State wishes them to go, it must allow them a
reasonable time to go away with their property; if
not, enemy subjects, who are subject to the regulations
of the police and of public safety have the right, so
long as they respect these laws, to appeal for protection
to them. In any case deliberate ill-treatment of
enemy subjects cannot be permitted.</p>

<p>This principle, by the confession of the Germans
themselves, condemns the methods to which Germany
has resorted by empowering her officials to behave
cruelly to French and Russian subjects who happened
to be in Germany on the 3rd August, and by tacitly
approving the behaviour of the mob to them.</p>

<p>The fear of spying, of which it appears that all these
people were suspected, perhaps because of the audacity
which the Germans themselves showed in resorting to
it in foreign countries, was invoked by the Germans
as the excuse for all these outrages and the justification
for all these annoyances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<h3>German Misconduct towards People Incapable
of Espionage</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, ill-treatment could not be justified in
this way. As a precaution against spying, foreigners
may be compelled to leave a country <i>en masse</i>. A
straightforward and honest supervision may be exercised
over them at their departure, but no one has
the right to allow them to be struck, nor to expose
them to the clamours of a mob, nor to speak to them
as if they were prisoners in the dock. Only definite
suspicion falling upon individuals would justify such
conduct, and by justifying it would give, in addition,
the rights of arrest and cross-examination.</p>

<p>People who are merely being brought back to their
own country in case of war have the right to be shown
every consideration by the authorities.</p>

<p>In all the disgraceful situations which German
officials and private citizens brought about in Germany
in their dealings with enemy subjects of Germany,
we can, therefore, see merely the expression of a
cowardly hatred of everything that belongs to the
powers hostile to Germany, powers which the Germans
think they are hitting when they insult and ill-treat
their peaceful and harmless citizens. The same feeling
which animated German officials against the Dowager
Empress of Russia, against the Grand Duke Constantin,
against the ambassadors, ministers and
consuls of Russia and France, could only assert itself
with still greater fury, devoid of all consideration and
all scruple, against plain French citizens or Russian
subjects. In this letting loose of evil passions there
were manifested features of grotesque arbitrariness.
For example, such was these people’s whim, every
woman who wore spectacles was subjected to a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
minute search than other travellers, on the ground,
it was alleged, that there was more likelihood of her
being a spy!</p>

<h3>How the Germans treated Russian
Travellers</h3>

<p>Thirty-two Russians belonging to the highest aristocracy,
who were passing the summer at Baden and
other bathing resorts, were arrested at Hamburg and
detained for several days. Thanks to the intervention
of the Spanish consul, M. Veler, they were able eventually
to continue their journey; but at Neumunster,
M. Schebeko, on the authority of a telegram from
Berlin, was suddenly arrested in the train, compelled
to get out of the carriage guarded by soldiers with
fixed bayonets, in the midst of a crowd shouting
“Shoot him!” He was then dragged off to prison,
where he spent twenty-four hours in a dark cell, in
the company of malefactors under the common law.</p>

<p>The Countess of Vorontsoff, daughter of the Viceroy
of the Caucasus, went so far as to protest. Immediately
the soldiers, in a rage, forced themselves into her
carriage, pushed her with the butt-ends of their rifles
on to the platform and began to search her. It was
only with great difficulty that the travellers were able
to resume their journey, which, from Baden to the
Danish frontier, lasted seven days. At Reudsburg
station they were again dragged from their carriage
and carefully searched: at the Fleusburg station they
were detained for four hours under a guard of armed
soldiers. Other Russian travellers of note were at
first brought to the frontier town of Eydtkuhnen, and
then dispatched again to Mecklenburg, and the
Island of Ruegen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The travellers were fearfully crowded together.
Some of them were put into cattle-trucks and had
nothing to eat or drink. Even women were not
spared blows with the fist and with the butt-ends of
rifles, nor threats of death. Several had to make long
marches on foot between rows of armed soldiers, and at
stopping-places had no shelter but pig-sties. A large
number of men aged from seventeen to fifty were stopped.</p>

<p>Husbands were taken away from their wives, children
were harshly treated, and left alone at the stopping-places
in spite of the cries of their mothers, who were
forced to continue their journey.</p>

<p>In the sanatorium at Frankfurt, which was filled
with a large number of foreigners, especially Russians,
several of whom had just been operated on, shameful
behaviour of the same kind took place. The sanatorium
was cleared in twenty-four hours. A woman
who had just been confined was sent to Berne, where she
arrived in a dying condition. Her baby died on the way.</p>

<p>After stories like these, we can easily imagine what
bad treatment travellers of less distinction had to
endure. The vicissitudes through which they passed
not merely astound, but revolt, the hearer. The
Russians who were brought to Sasuitz, for the most
part robbed of all that they had, agreed to make the
following declaration—</p>

<p>“Those who wish to do so may take the boat to
go back to Sweden. Those who do not wish to return
to Sweden <i>will remain here, as prisoners of war, until
the end of the war</i>. The women will sew linen for our
soldiers, the men will be employed in making trenches.
Whoever departs from the appointed place where he
is to stop will be brought before a court-martial and
will be shot. We do not guarantee regular food.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<h3>How the Germans Behaved to French
Residents and Travellers</h3>

<p>The French were no more spared than the Russians.
At Kembs, fronting Istein, the German authorities
blew up with dynamite Monsignor Kannengieser’s
dwelling-house. The noble prelate, who was almost
blind, was shamefully ill-treated, because (such is the
statement of the <i>Liberté de Fribourg</i>) he had in his
possession plans of Istein.</p>

<p>As for French travellers going back to France, their
journey was checked at any moment by the police,
who stopped them for long hours, if not for whole
days, at every station. Several found that they were
treated like regular prisoners; on the slightest suspicion
they were shut up in dark cells, and in order
to intimidate them or to drag confessions out of them,
they were threatened with death. Those who were
not stopped by the police were unmercifully beaten
by the crowd, who loaded them with insults.</p>

<p>At Hanover a child who was wearing the inscription
<i>France</i> on the ribbon of its hat was dragged from its
mother and ill-treated.</p>

<p>At Donaueschingen a certain number of women
were compelled by the German military authorities
to discontinue their journey, and were brought to a
school, where they had to sleep on straw.</p>

<p>They got the benefit, however, of the sole and only
act of charity which was performed during the whole
of this time in Germany towards an enemy subject,
for the Princess of Fürstenberg, whose castle is at
Donaueschingen, hearing of their condition, had beds
given them in a hospital of which she is patroness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">OUTRAGES ON NEUTRAL SUBJECTS</span></h2>

<p>In these acts of unbridled violence due note should
be made of the fact that German officials, officers and
private soldiers made no distinction between individuals
who held public offices and mere private citizens.
Still more worthy of note is the fact, which we think
is obvious, that they made no distinction between
the subjects of enemy and those of neutral states.
The sacred duty laid upon every State to protect
the life, property and even the interests of neutrals
was absolutely repudiated in Germany, and we think
it is our duty to draw the reader’s attention with
special emphasis to outrages of this kind committed
by the Germans both in Germany and in the territories
which they invaded.</p>

<h3>Outrages committed by the Germans on Neutral
Subjects Resident in Germany</h3>

<p>M. Bernardino del Campo, ex-Minister of Finance
of Brazil, ex-President of Sao-Paolo and leader of the
Republican Party of that country, happened to be
on the 3rd August at Bad-Nauheim with his wife,
who was taking a course of treatment there, and his
four children. The Germans showed no consideration
either for his nationality, his rank or his age. M.
Bernardino del Campo, although he had reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
age of sixty-two years, was struck with the butt-end
of the rifle by Bavarian soldiers, robbed of his
jewels and left dying at the Swiss frontier.</p>

<p><i>The news of this incident caused great indignation in
Brazil.</i></p>

<p>Baroness Karen-Groothe, daughter of the King of
Denmark’s Master of the Hunt, and wife of a Turkish
officer, happened to be at Mecklenberg when war was
declared, and was arrested as a spy and treated so
brutally that she had to keep to her bed at Copenhagen,
to which she was brought back.</p>

<p>Several Danish subjects resident in Schleswig were
treated with the same kind of brutality. Count de
Schack was imprisoned; when, on his release, he tried
to escape across the Danish frontier, he was arrested
again and sent to a fortress in the interior of Germany.
The editors of the Danish papers in Schleswig, and a
large number of distinguished people in the annexed
provinces, were also imprisoned.</p>

<p>Americans were no better treated than Danes. The
<i>New York Sun</i> (11th August, 1914) discussed the
treatment of Americans in Germany in an article
dealing with the arrest of Mr. Archer Huntington and
his wife on a baseless charge of espionage, and the
brutality with which several young Americans had
been treated.</p>

<p>“It would seem that the German authorities” (said
the <i>Sun</i>) “think that in war there is no obstacle to
their will and no atonement for their acts. The
American Government will speedily have to disabuse
them of this idea. Germany must be made to understand
clearly that ample compensation is due to
her victims, and that those who have abused their
authority must be punished.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<h3>In Austria</h3>

<p>The Austrian authorities were as discourteous as
the German to foreigners, subjects of neutral countries.
At Carlsbad the famous singer, Adelina Patti, and
her husband, Baron Cederstrom, a Danish subject,
were kept prisoners for several days in their hotel,
where the police searched everything and rummaged
through all their trunks and portmanteaus, while the
crowd, who threatened to carry the hotel by assault,
raised a hideous din by way of demonstration against
the singer, who is a friend of Russia and France.</p>

<p>According to the Italian newspaper <i>Messagero</i>, an
Italian commercial traveller, M. Ugo Lorenzini, and
ten fellow-countrymen were ill-treated by the Austrians
on their return from Berlin to Italy on the outbreak
of hostilities. They were imprisoned at Innsbruck,
then shut up in a motor wagon, which took a day
and a half to bring them to Trente. There they were
robbed of everything they had, especially of 2000
crowns, which was all the money in their possession.
For a whole week the Austrians actually kept them
digging trenches for fifteen hours a day: hardly any
food was given them and they were struck with sticks
and swords. One morning, after one of them had
killed the guard, they managed to escape. A Trentino
peasant helped them to make good their flight to the
Italian frontier, where they arrived in a state of
exhaustion.</p>

<h3>Crimes committed by Germans against Neutral
Subjects in the invaded Countries</h3>

<p>The most serious of these crimes was that committed
by the soldiers of Lieutenant-colonel Blegen
at Dinant against M. Himmer, Vice-Consul of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Argentine. This vice-consul, who ought to have been
respected not merely as a non-combatant and a neutral,
but because his consular rank should have protected
him, was killed, and the Argentine flag trampled under
foot, with the result that keen indignation was aroused
in the Argentine.</p>

<p>Amongst the many inhabitants at Liège who were
shot were <i>five young people of Spanish nationality</i>.
They were massacred on the 20th August. Their
names were known and were as follows: the brothers
Oliver, Juan and Antonio, natives of Oller, Jaime
Llabres of Majorca, Juan Nora and José Nielle.</p>

<p>The Consul-General of the Balearic Islands, who
had received confirmation of this report, made an
official request to the Spanish Government that they
should protest against these outrages and exact
reparation—that is to say, present a demand for an
indemnity for the families of the murdered men, and
in order to make the demand effective, seize all the
German ships which had taken refuge in Spanish ports.</p>

<p>In France, at Jarny, twelve kilometres from Briey,
the German soldiers, not satisfied with other acts of
barbarism which they had committed, shot in addition
thirteen Italian subjects. Here is the story of these
murders, given by one of the comrades of the victims,
the Italian Agostino Baccheta de Gattico of Novara,
in the <i>Gazetta del Popolo</i> (see the <i>Matin</i> for 27th August,
1914).</p>

<p>At Jarny, Baccheta ran a small café which was a
rendezvous for Italians, some of whom were his
boarders. He returned to Italy, after a long and
painful journey, accompanied by the sister of one of
the men who had been shot.</p>

<p>“It was about eight o’clock in the morning, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
3rd August,” said he, “when several battalions of
the 63rd German infantry regiment, with some cavalry
and artillery, got as far as Jarny, without meeting
with much resistance from the French, who were not
in great numbers.</p>

<p>“The Germans lost one man killed and four wounded.
They immediately accused the inhabitants of having
fired on their party, and, having summoned the chief
magistrate and the local doctor, ordered them to
assemble the whole male population on the open space
of the village.</p>

<p>“Women and children were knocked down. When
they wanted to follow their men-folk they were brutally
driven back with the butt-ends of rifles and several
were bayoneted. A woman, named Giuseppa Trolli,
tried to prevent her husband getting out of the bed
where he was lying seriously ill, and called out to the
Germans, ‘Savage brutes.’ She, and the child which
she was holding in her arms, were wounded.</p>

<p>“When all the men had assembled, patrols began to
search the houses. In the rooms of my café, which
had been let to some Italians, they found pickaxes
and other tools. This was the excuse for arresting
and immediately afterwards shooting the workmen,
whose names are as follows: Gerolamo Bernacchini of
Gattico; Giovanni Testa of Bergama; Angelo Luisetti
of Borgomanero; Stefano Piralli of Gattico; Giovani
Zoni of Trevisa.</p>

<p>“In the inn kept by a man named Gaggioli Stefano
of Serralunga, two rusty revolvers were found. The
proprietor of the inn, a man named Vaglia Giuseppe
of Castelamonte, and Cesaroni Vincenzo of Viterbe,
were arrested and paid with their lives for what this
search had yielded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Finally, in the Carrera Café, a fowling-piece was
found belonging to Pesenti Luigi, of Milan, who was
forthwith shot.”</p>

<p>Bachetta adds that some days afterwards the
following were arrested and shot: Giovanni Tron of
Conegliano; Andrew Bisesti of Bologna; a lad of
thirteen years old called Eurigo Maffi of Lugo; Amilcare
Zoni of Trevisa, because, when asking for a passport
of repatriation, they had questioned the German
Commandant in a spirited manner.</p>

<p>Italian refugees informed the consular authorities
of the tragedy of which their companions had been
the victims. They then went to Gattico to bring to
M. Niccolo Leonardi the material proofs of their
story.</p>

<p><i>Spanish subjects resident in Reims</i> suffered dreadfully
during the German occupation and the famous bombardment,
which we describe in detail further on.</p>

<p>During the occupation, M. Rolland, a Spanish subject,
was ill-treated and fifty German soldiers looted everything
in the restaurant of which he was proprietor,
especially his cellar.</p>

<p>Several other houses and shops belonging to
Spaniards, over which their national flag was flying,
were systematically pillaged.</p>

<p>The bombardment of September 18-20 had fresh
disasters in store for the Spanish residents of Reims.
The Spanish Consulate was bombarded although the
Spanish flag made it conspicuous and all the Spaniards
of Reims had taken refuge there on the advice of a
Frenchman, M. Humbert, who, in the absence of the
vice-consul, Cama, had taken charge of Spanish
interests. The house of Narcisso Torres, which also
had the Spanish flag upon it, was struck by two shells.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Father Torres, aged seventy-six years and ill, died of
excitement. M. Antonio’s house was set on fire; his
daughter, aged eleven years, was seriously wounded.</p>

<p>In the outskirts of Reims, the premises of the well-known
Spanish firm, Montener &amp; Co., were bombarded
four times, and suffered damage which might be
estimated at 500,000 francs.</p>

<p>The Spanish committee of Paris, which had sent a
deputation to the department of the Marne, to report
upon the disasters of the war, protested as soon as
they received the report of their deputies against the
crimes committed in defiance of the Spanish flag and
of humanity.</p>

<p>Finally, let us add that, at the time of the second
bombardment of Dunkirk, which was carried out by
German aeroplanes (22nd January, 1915), the United
States consul, Mr. Benjamin Morel, was wounded
by a bursting bomb. The consulates of the United
States, Norway and Uruguay were, in addition, struck
by explosive projectiles thrown by German airmen.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">GERMAN USE OF PROHIBITED IMPLEMENTS OF
WAR</span></h2>

<p>Among savage races, or even nearer home, before
certain agreements had been made between nations,
poisoned or barbed arrows, small shot, pounded glass,
and soft-nosed bullets were used to aggravate the
condition of wounded enemies to the worst possible
extent. To-day all these contrivances are prohibited,
with the consent of Germany, who signed the conventions
which embodied this prohibition. German
jurists like Bluntschli approved this concurrence of
opinion, and the German General Hartmann declared
that for a long time these kinds of projectiles have
gone into the lumber-rooms of arsenals.</p>

<p>This fact, however, did not prevent Germany from
resorting in this war to the use of weapons of the
same kind, or even the still more formidable dum-dum
bullets. Moreover, dum-dum bullets are expressly
specified among the list of prohibitions laid down by
the Hague Conference, 29th July, 1899, prohibitions
signed by Germany and her ally Austria. These
declare that “the contracting parties forbid the use
of bullets which expand or easily get flattened in the
human body, such as bullets with a hard outer case
which does not completely cover the core or is notched
at the end.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Use of Dum-dum Bullets in Belgium</h3>

<p>The report of the military governor of Ghent,
Lieutenant-general L. Clooten, and the results of
experiments made by M. V. Rousseaux, armoury
expert at Antwerp, prove indisputably that these
bullets were in use among the Germans. The following
is the report—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<i>Headquarters at Ghent, 26th September, 1914.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

cartridges with bullets of the kind called ‘dum-dum,’

before his capture, could not be found again.</p>

<p>The following is the result of the experiment made
by M. V. Rousseaux—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The box with green label which you send me
(20 cartridges for Mauser self-loading pistols of calibre
7·63) must have contained full cartridges. It contains
three rows of expanding dum-dum bullets, taken
from the special boxes with yellow labels. These
bullets were made to expand by the process of manufacture,
and it is impossible to make them so by hand.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Use of Dum-dum Bullets on French Soil</h3>

<p>The first instance of the use of dum-dum bullets
on French soil goes back to the early days of the war.
It was denounced by the French Government in the
protest which they addressed (21st August, 1914) to
the signatory powers of the Hague Convention.</p>

<p>This protest points out that “on the 10th August,
1914, after an engagement between French and German
troops, a surgeon-major sent to the general in command
of the Infantry Brigade” a case found on the road
to Munster “close to the German Custom-House,”
which contained five cartridges primed with cylindro-conical
bullets cut at the end, the nickel cover of which
was incomplete and left bare the upper portion of
the lead slug.</p>

<p>This was not the only instance. On the 14th
September, Dr. Chas. Lavielle, superintendent of
the auxiliary hospital of Baignots-à-Dax, sent to the
sub-prefect of the department of Landes a report on
the operations which had been performed on patients,
and declared that four of them had been struck by
expanding bullets. Photographs were appended to
the report.</p>

<p>Doctor Napieralski, physician-in-chief of the 7th
auxiliary hospital of the third French army corps
à Pont Audemer, noted the case of a foot soldier
wounded in the shoulder with a huge scar as big as
an open hand. It was not an ordinary wound.</p>

<p>The wounded man’s name was Adrien Bousquet,
the foreman of some electricity works at Verdalles.
He related (said the report) that on the 2nd November,
in a battle to the East of Ypres, he found himself cut
off with his section from the rest of his company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>For three days his comrades and he fired from a
trench, but at last, on the 5th November, they were
outnumbered. The majority surrendered. Bousquet,
however, not wishing to be made prisoner, tried to
escape towards the main body of his troop. He was
fired at from different sides. All at once he felt in
his shoulder so violent a concussion that it actually
turned him round. Still, it was only a bullet which
had struck him.</p>

<p>Dr. Napieralski noted that there could be no question
of a wound caused by a bursting shell, for the wound
showed no trace of powder nor any blackish stain of
metallic oxide.</p>

<p>As the wounded man was carrying his knapsack
on his back, Dr. Napieralski adds that the explosive
force of the bullet was increased by the pressure of
the knapsack. The result was that the sinews were
torn over a wide surface and the bone formation of
the shoulder-blade was shattered.</p>

<p>The depositions of the other wounded men who
took part in the battle in which Bousquet was wounded
confirm all his statements. On that day, at this point
on the front, no artillery battle took place, and the
Germans made use of many explosive bullets; no
mistake is possible on this point, for it is easy to recognise
them because as soon as they touch the ground,
or any obstacle whatever, they burst with a dry,
crackling noise. All the wounded who were questioned
quote typical examples of deaths and wounds caused
by these bullets; they also mention numerous witnesses,
soldiers, their own comrades, whose evidence
it is easy to collect and who will confirm their statements
(<i>Temps</i>, 29th December).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<h3>Use of the Same Kind of Bullets in the
Colonies</h3>

<p>German troops have used dum-dum bullets on all
fronts and at every point where military operations
were in progress. The fact that they have done so
was proved particularly in the Togoland battles and
confirmed by the English Governor of the Gold Coast
in his report to the Colonial Minister in London
(September 1914).</p>

<h3>Counter-accusations by the Germans</h3>

<p>The discovery of these facts could not fail to arouse
universal indignation which Germany tried to forestall
by accusing her enemies of similar acts. The
Kaiser used the Wolff Bureau to make this accusation
against France and England, and lodged a complaint
against both with the President of the United States.
France immediately issued a denial in a telegram
under date 11th September, 1914. Another denial
drawn up on September 8 had come from England.</p>

<p>The <i>Lokal-Anzeiger</i> and the <i>Tag</i> of Berlin (September
10) published facsimiles of cartridges, and of
pouches of cartridges alleged to be <i>dum-dum</i>, found
by German troops at Longwy. Now, the very inscription
on these pouches—“Practice Cartridges”—showed
the futility of the accusation, for it proves
that here we have to do merely with ammunition
for use at the rifle-ranges of military training clubs.
As these ranges sometimes had to be prepared in a
hurry, it was a case of necessity to send them cartridges
crushed at the end, so that the speed of the
bullet should be reduced and that it should not go
right through targets which were not thick enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>These cartridges were not even used at the regimental
rifle-range, and the fact that they neutralise the
projectile capacity of the French rifle was a still
stronger reason why nobody ever thought of using
them in war.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Germans left at Compiègne, and on
several battlefields of France, pouches, carefully put
in a conspicuous position, of French cartridges which
they had made into dum-dum bullets by scooping
out the protruding end. The object of this artifice
was to give currency to the belief that these prohibited
missiles were used by the French troops.</p>

<p>The following is the reply made by the President
of the United States to the Emperor of Germany.
“In reply to your protest, the United States can do
nothing. I do not think your Majesty expects me
to say more.”</p>

<h3>Doctors attached to the German Medical Service
have admitted that the German Accusation
was False</h3>

<p>People who allowed themselves to be deceived by
an accusation which had its origin in Germany soon
received proof, and from Germany too, that the
accusation was false.</p>

<p>Professor Straub, of Freiburg in Bresgau, published
in a Munich medical journal the results of his inquiry
into the nature of the French bullet. He admitted
that, from the medical point of view, this bullet was
composed of an admirable alloy, which could not
poison, and he came to the conclusion that it was
humane. Dr. Haberlin, a Swiss doctor attached to
the hospitals at Arlon and at Louisburg, where he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
chiefly German wounded under his care, declared
on his honour that he had never heard tell of wounds
inflicted on Germans by dum-dum bullets.</p>

<h3>Dum-dum Bullets used Against the Russians</h3>

<p>That the Germans used dum-dum bullets against
the Russians was proved in a hospital at Vilna, where
a lieutenant-colonel in the Russian infantry, wounded
in the leg, chanced to be under treatment. The
wound, which at its entrance was smaller than a
penny, was as large as a hand where the bullet left
the body.</p>

<p>The photograph of one of the dum-dum bullets
used in this way was given by the <i>Novoïé Vrémia</i> on
17th September, 1914.</p>

<p>Moreover, the German missiles used against the
Russian troops often gave off poisonous gases which
caused the death of the wounded, and which were
expressly forbidden by the Hague Conventions (1899)
under the category of “projectiles, the sole purpose
of which is to spread asphyxiating or noxious gases.”</p>

<h3>The Same Practices followed in Austria</h3>

<p>The use of explosive bullets by the German troops
was regularly followed by their allies, the Austrians,
both on the Russian front and the Serbian.</p>

<p>The superintendent of the Red Cross at Petrograd
was informed at the beginning of the war by his
deputy at the first outpost detachment that, after
Austrian field works had been taken, a large quantity
of explosive bullets in special pouches and in belts
for use in machine-guns had been found, and also
many spent cartridges which had been adapted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
this kind of bullet. These bullets bore the date 1914,
and were used on every occasion that the Russians
took the offensive.</p>

<p>On the other hand, “The use of explosive bullets
by the Austrians,” declared an official note of the
Russian Government, “has been often proved by
medical reports and photographs of wounds.” Cartridges
and bullets which have been captured leave
no doubt on that point. The Russian troops which
had succeeded in taking the village of Lajenki, near
Nemirof, found there 10,000 explosive bullets, the
place of origin of which is obvious from the fact that
they had the stamp of an Austrian arsenal upon them.</p>

<p>On the 21st October, near Przemsyl, the Russian
troops took some machine-guns, the belts of which
were full of cartridges with explosive bullets.</p>

<p>Moreover, all the Serbian generals without exception
declared that the Austrians employed explosive
bullets on the whole Serbian front. The first ten
rounds from the machine-guns were always, they
said, made with this kind of bullet, and the Austrian
soldiers were provided with explosive cartridges in
the proportion of 20 per cent.</p>

<p>Again, Dr. Reiss, professor at the University of
Lausanne, who was sent to Serbia as a special commissioner
of the <i>Gazette de Lausanne</i>, and who returned
from his expedition on the 10th December,
told of numerous Austrian bullets which had been
found on Balkan battlefields and which all the
marksmen to whom they were shown declared to be
explosive.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">GERMAN TREACHERY ON THE BATTLEFIELD</span></h2>

<h3>Abuse of the Privilege allowed to Bearers of
a Flag of Truce and to Prisoners</h3>

<p>The following are some examples of this dastardly
conduct. At Liège, the Germans resorted to it against
the Commandant of the Bucelles fort, upon whom
they treacherously made a murderous attack. They
appeared with a flag of truce and demanded the surrender
of the fort. “I refuse,” he replied. “Commandant,”
was the answer, “come and see the
condition of your defence works. You will agree
that they can hold out no longer.”</p>

<p>The Commandant went off with the Germans,
intending to show them the satisfactory condition
of the works. Scarcely had he crossed the threshold
when they fired their revolvers at him. The brave
officer received two bullets in the thigh and only by
chance got away from this murderous attack.</p>

<p>A similar case happened during the siege of Liège.
On the night of 5-6th August about a hundred German
soldiers came to a point 750 metres from the Belgian
trenches, and, throwing down their arms, held up
their hands and waved white flags. The Belgian
Commandant gave the order to cease firing, and went
towards the spot with some men. He had hardly
gone more than about thirty yards when he fell,
mortally wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Near Hofstade, in Belgium, on the 26th August, the
Germans advanced to the attack in the same way,
preceded by a white flag.</p>

<p>In a battle which took place sixty kilometres from
Lemberg, the Austrians resorted to the same means.
The regiment of the Russian Colonel Frolow having
attacked them with the bayonet, they hoisted the
white flag. The colonel immediately gave the order
to halt. He himself went alone to the enemy’s position
and gave the order to cease firing. In vain, for as he
was going back to his men he was mortally wounded.</p>

<h3>Other Forms of German Treachery</h3>

<p>One form of treachery repeated very often by the
Germans was to sound the bugle calls of enemy troops
and thus mislead them. In the thick of the battles
round about Mulhausen, in the beginning of August,
the French were not a little surprised to hear the call
to cease firing. Fortunately, one of the superior
officers saw through the enemy’s treachery and immediately
ordered the signal to be given for attack,
which sent the Germans flying helter-skelter. As
such acts in German eyes are permissible stratagems,
they constantly resorted to them. Another consisted
<i>in marching civilians of the invaded countries in front
of the German troops</i>. One of the officers who did this,
Lieutenant A. Eberlein, has with extraordinary composure
related in one of the most reputable German
newspapers (<i>Münchener Neueste Nachrichten</i>, 7th
October, 1914) how he resorted to this device.</p>

<p>“We stopped three people,” writes this officer, “as
we were going into Saint Dié; and then a fine idea
occurred to me. We gave them chairs, and ordered
them to carry these into the middle of the street and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
sit down. Entreaties followed on the one side, and
some blows with the butt-end of the rifle on the other.
By degrees one gets frightfully harsh. At last they sat
down outside in the street. I do not know what prayers
they said, but their hands were all the time clasped as if
they had cramp. I was sorry for them, but the plan
served its purpose and at once the firing aimed from the
houses at our flanks immediately slackened, and we
could now occupy the house opposite and in that way
had command of the principal street. Everybody who
showed himself in the street after this was shot. Moreover,
the artillery had been hard at work all this time,
and when, at seven o’clock in the evening, the brigade
came up to our rescue, I was able to report, ‘Saint
Dié is cleared of enemies.’</p>

<p>“As I learnt later, the reserve regiment … which
entered Saint Dié further north, had experiences exactly
like ours. The four people whom they also had compelled
to sit in the street were killed by French bullets.
I myself saw them lying in the middle of the street
near the hospital.”</p>

<p>According to information which will complete the
story and which appeared two months later in the
Saint Dié <i>Gazette Vosgienne</i>, the names of the four
people stopped by the reserve regiment “which
entered Saint Dié further north” were Camille Chôtel,
carpenter, aged thirty-four years; Léon George, twenty-seven;
Henri Louzy and Georges Visser. They were
compelled, not merely to sit down, but to march in
front of the German detachment.</p>

<p>The same thing happened elsewhere on other
occasions.</p>

<p><i>In Belgium</i>, near Liège, on the 6th August, when
two captive Belgian soldiers who had been forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to march before the German troops met their death
at the hands of their fellow-countrymen. At Dietz,
on the 26th August, several women and children,
who had been barbarously compelled to play the same
part, were struck by the fire of the German troops.</p>

<p>At Marchiennes several hundred persons were driven
in front of a German column. At Erpe, on the 12th
September, a German column of two hundred to
three hundred men, which had been fired upon by
a Belgian machine-gun, took twenty to twenty-five
young men, among whom was a lad of only thirteen
years, and placed them in the middle of the road,
with the result that these young people were in the
line of fire. Two were wounded and the firing was
stopped. In the fight at Alost, on the 26th September,
the Germans drove before them several people, whose
names are given by the Belgian Commission of Inquiry
in one of their reports. At Lierre-Sainte-Marie four
priests officiating in a church were taken by the
Prussians, because they had not been quick enough
in bringing the service to a close and had thereby
delayed the quartering of the troops in the church.
On the following day they were obliged to march
in front of the soldiers and all four were killed.</p>

<p><i>In France</i> the same crime was repeated twenty
times. We shall not record all the cases. In the
battle at Billy, on the 10th August, according to an
official report of the French Commandant, the Germans
compelled several women and children to march in
front of them, as a screen for themselves and to prevent
the French firing on them as they were coming out
of the village and filing on to the battlefield.</p>

<p>In the Belfort area the Germans stripped a great
number of prisoners, drove them in front of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
line, and exposed them almost naked to the French
bullets.</p>

<p>At Denain, on the 25th August, the German cavalry,
at two o’clock in the morning, compelled women and
children to march in front of the column; at Méry (in
the Department of the Oise), during a battle with the
French on the 1st September, the Germans seized
the manager of a sugar-refinery, his family, and the
whole staff of the works, and made them march side
by side with them, as a screen against a fusillade on
their flank. As a result, a workwoman, Mlle. Jeansenne,
was killed by a French bullet. The foreman of the
works was wounded.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">BOMBARDMENT OF UNDEFENDED TOWNS. CRIMES
COMMITTED DURING BOMBARDMENT. DEFINITION OF
BOMBARDMENT</span></h2>

<p>The bombardment of towns, villages, and dwelling-houses
is forbidden when these places have no military
defence. If they have, bombardment is permitted,
but under certain conditions. The commander who
carries it on is bound to give notice beforehand to the
enemy authorities, or at least to do everything he can
to warn them. In the second place, bombardment
must spare buildings dedicated to religion, science,
and philanthropy, and also hospitals and centres for
the sick and wounded, provided, of course—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) that these buildings have not been used for
military purposes;</p>

<p>(2) that they are distinguished by some mark
besiegers can see.</p>

</div>

<p>Consequently, the crimes which an army may commit,
so far as bombardment is concerned, are as
follows—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) bombardment of an undefended town or
village.</p>

<p>(2) bombardment of a town or village without
previous notice.</p>

<p>(3) bombardment of churches, monuments,
scientific and charitable institutions, hospitals,
ambulances.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h3>Undefended Towns bombarded by the
Germans</h3>

<p>The Germans committed all these crimes simultaneously,
but the least excusable and most cruel of all
was the bombardment of towns which the enemy had
evacuated, and to which, therefore, he could render no
further aid.</p>

<p>Three French towns and districts, Pont-à-Mousson,
Douai, and Lille, met with this fate from artillery and
aeroplanes.</p>

<h3>Bombardment of Pont-à-Mousson</h3>

<p>This began on the 11th August, continued the following
day, then on the 14th August and finally became
intermittent. The firing on the town was resumed more
than a hundred times. It was an open town, however,
and the French army were not defending it, further
than that the bridge over the Moselle had been put in
a state of defence at the outbreak of hostilities by the
26th light infantry battalion.</p>

<p>Moreover, the bombardment of Pont-à-Mousson took
place without previous warning, and was not preceded
by any notice, nor any occupation by the German troops,
who did not even show themselves (on the 11th, 12th
and 14th August) before the town. The operation was
carried out by means of guns placed in concealment on
the other side of the frontier. The firing was directed
by an airship flying over the batteries.</p>

<p>Acts of this kind are the proof of a deliberate and
premeditated desire to destroy and to terrorise. In
this case destruction is here not the inevitable sequence
to attack and defence, but an end pursued for its own
sake in contravention and defiance of established laws.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Thanks to the signals given by the airship, the German
batteries were able to damage the St. Martin quarter,
on the right bank of the Moselle, and the site of the new
hospital and the college. The hospital was flying the
Red Cross flag, but was struck precisely for that very
reason: a shell burst near the bed in which a wounded
Saxon officer was under treatment. Fortunately, no
one in the hospital was wounded, though not less than
seventy shells struck the building during the 14th
August. In the rest of the town forty people were
killed and as many wounded. They were women and
children.</p>

<h3>Bombardment of Douai</h3>

<p>Towards the end of the month of August the town of
Douai served as a storehouse for numerous German
troops. It was formerly occupied on the 1st October.
The outrages which it suffered from the Germans on
the 8th and 12th October were committed against a
town which it was, in fact, impossible for the French to
defend. On the 8th October a Taube bombarded Douai,
throwing two bombs, which did little damage. On the
12th October a second Taube threw another bomb, which
burst behind M. Mathieu’s house, in the Rue d’Hesdin,
and killed a little girl named Briois, aged five years,
who was closing the windows of a house.</p>

<h3>Bombardment of Lille</h3>

<p>On the 10th October, when the French were coming
up to Lille, the Germans forcibly carried off M. Delesalle,
mayor of the town; M. Ducastel, municipal councillor,
and several other municipal officials. Then, when they
had almost evacuated the town, they directed against
it a furious bombardment, which began on the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of the 10th October and continued, with a short interval,
until the 12th October at 9 o’clock in the morning. The
Rue Faidherbe was completely demolished and the
end of the Rue de l’Hôpital Militaire was terribly
damaged. Many fires broke out in the Rues de Paris,
du Mélinel and de Béthune. The town hall, the prefecture,
the post office, the Palais des Beaux Arts were
injured. The Kulmann and Wallaert works were burnt
down. The <i>Times</i> correspondent stated that a bomb
thrown by a Taube, near the prefecture, wounded a
woman who was walking along, and killed by her side
her little son, aged twelve years.</p>

<p>Let us repeat that this bombardment of Lille took
place when the French were only coming up to the town
and that the latter had not been completely evacuated
by the Germans, who were, therefore, guilty of violation
of the laws of war. It was the same with the bombardment
carried on upon the 11th and 12th November.
On this occasion also the allied troops were only coming
up. More than 7000 shells fell on the town during the
time the Germans remained there. The presence of the
Germans is proved by one abominable detail. It is
a fact that they had cut the water-pipes in order that
the fires kindled by the bombardment could not be
put out. A little later they were compelled to blow up
houses with melinite to stop the fire which was spreading
in all directions.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the month of December Lille
had a total of 998 burnt houses. During the bombardment
the College Saint-Joseph, which was flying a
white flag as a signal that it should be spared, was
struck by two shells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h3>Bombardment of Belgrade</h3>

<p>On account of its geographical situation the capital
of Serbia was evacuated by Serbian troops. Only
civilians remained and the Red Cross flag was hoisted.
Consequently the town was entitled to think itself
immune from outrage and bombardment. Nothing
of the kind was the case.</p>

<p>Belgrade was bombarded on the 28th and 30th July,
then from the 16th to the 18th August, and finally on
the 14th and 15th September. Several quarters of
the town were burnt; many of the inhabitants were
killed, amongst others two mental patients in a private
asylum.</p>

<p>As soon as a fire broke out, the places round the
burning building were riddled with bullets, so that the
residents could neither put out the fire nor localise it.</p>

<p>In the midst of all the turmoil the Serbian Government
took care to lodge its complaint with the Powers,
through their representatives.</p>

<h3>Bombardments without Notice</h3>

<p>We should not forget that the notice of bombardment
required by the laws of war was impossible in more cases
than one. Moreover, it is admitted that attacking
troops are absolved from the charge of breach of these
laws, when they do all they can to give warning. Besides,
warning of bombardment is not always required to
make an attacked town expect it. We could not, therefore,
regard as a contravention of law all bombardments,
without exception, which the Germans had made without
giving notice. But, this said, can we allow to pass the
circumstance that, of all these bombardments, only two,
those of Antwerp and Reims, were preceded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
necessary warning? German callousness and cruelty
stand self-condemned by the fact that the proportion
is so small. Add that the bombardment of Reims,
started on the pretext that two German bearers of a
flag of truce, who had lost their way in the French lines,
were not brought back quickly enough, was in itself a
sheer outrage.</p>

<h3>Towns bombarded behind the Lines</h3>

<p>One kind of bombardment for which there is no excuse
is that in which German aircraft engaged over towns
and villages behind the enemy lines, out of the reach
of German guns and sometimes even outside the theatre
of war. It is certain that the intention to give oneself
up to such acts absolutely precludes respect for open
towns and for preliminary warnings. It is the proof
of an absolute contempt for the laws of war, and of a
fixed determination to act contrary to ordinary good
sense.</p>

<p>The bombing of Paris, Antwerp (25th August to
2nd Sept.), Dunkirk, Warsaw—towns all of which were
situated, when the attack took place, out of the range of
German cannon, is an outrage of a special kind. No
military object was in view, but merely a desire to
terrorise the civil population. At Paris six people were
killed and about thirty wounded: at Antwerp there
were twelve people killed and twenty-five wounded;
at Dunkirk about fifteen were killed and more than
twenty wounded; at Warsaw 106 people were injured.
All these victims—except at Warsaw, where among
the people struck were nine soldiers—were civilians, for
the most part women, children and old men. Hence
we understand the indignation aroused among neutrals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
by these bombardments, and the care which several
nations took to protest against them.</p>

<p>The American Committee, founded by the United
States ambassador in Paris, and consisting of the most
influential Americans resident in Paris, was entrusted
with the duty of keeping an eye upon the conduct of
Germans on the outskirts of the French capital and
above it. They were indignant at the deadly acts of
the German aeroplanes in Paris, and dispatched a report
on the subject. As for the throwing of bombs on
Antwerp, the American newspapers denounced it and
emphatically assigned it to its category. The <i>World</i>
described this kind of attack as “murder, pure and
simple”; “dynamite for children,” said the <i>New York
Herald</i>; the <i>New York Times</i> spoke of “crime against
humanity”; and the <i>Tribune</i> energetically protested
against the repetition of murder so blind, so purposeless
and so unpardonable.</p>

<h3>Bombardment of Malines and Lierre</h3>

<p>When the Belgians took Malines again, on the 25th
August, the Germans began to bombard it. This act
can only be put down to a thirst for vengeance. They
made violent efforts to demolish it quarter by quarter
by bursting shells. One shell struck a bakehouse and
killed two workmen in it. The cathedral, the museum,
the town hall, St. Peter’s Church, the magistrates’
court, and all the buildings round about the “Grand
Place” were badly damaged, and the ministers of
State of the Triple Entente, who visited Malines on the
13th September, saw shells smashing in before their eyes
the pro-cathedral of Saint-Rombaud, full of miracles
of art, where Van Dyck’s “Christ upon the Cross”
towered high above the tombs of the archbishops;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
they witnessed also the destruction of the famous old
carillon of the pro-cathedral, and the belfries of churches,
convents and seminaries buried beneath the ruins
(<i>vide</i> the photograph of one of the chapels of “Our
Lady of Malines” after the Germans had passed by, in
<i>L’Illustration</i> for the 3rd October).</p>

<p>What is left of Malines? A German journalist, war-correspondent
of the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>, undertook to
reply to this question, in a description, entitled <i>Malines
the Dead</i>, of the town in the condition in which the
German bombardment left it.</p>

<p>“Life has become extinct. The town is dead. The
sixty thousand inhabitants have fled. The melancholy
houses stand open. The streets are empty. German
soldiers go up and down. In the Grand Place, the
wool-market, the Place d’Egmont, at the railway station,
soldiers are working in larger groups, but the
ordinary residents are wanting.</p>

<p>“The emptiness and the havoc in these venerable-looking
streets are so awful and so overwhelming that
one’s breath is stopped and one recalls with terror the
legend of towns that bore a curse upon them. What no
one has ever seen, what Hoffmann and Edgar Poe have
never dreamed of in their morbid visions, has here
become a reality.</p>

<p>“In the midst of the town rises the cathedral, a
Gothic building of gigantic size. The tower, 100 metres
high, bounds the horizon on the west. At the top, at a
height which makes the brain reel, four dials, fourteen
metres in diameter, are twisted and riddled with bullets.
Shells have hollowed out seven holes in the wall.”</p>

<p>Lierre, a town of 26,000 inhabitants, was, like Malines,
pitilessly bombarded towards the end of September.</p>

<p>When the cannonade began the inhabitants concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
themselves in cellars, but shortly afterwards they fled.
Several among them took refuge in Antwerp. Many
houses in the town were destroyed and a certain number
of people were wounded. A shell even struck a hospital
and killed nine persons.</p>

<h3>Bombardment of Mars-la-Tour</h3>

<p>The village of Mars-la-Tour, in Lorraine, was bombarded
by the Germans on the 16th August, the
anniversary of the battle which took place in 1870. They
cannonaded the memorial church, Abbé Faller’s <i>Musée
patriotique</i>, and the monument to commemorate the
battle of 1870. The bombardment lasted a full hour,
and took place with mathematical regularity. Only
one house was damaged, which proves that the buildings
mentioned were the carefully chosen target of the
German guns; two persons, an old mechanic and a
woman, were fatally injured. The other inhabitants
took refuge in the cellars.</p>

<h3>Bombardment of Étain</h3>

<p>On the 24th August, at one o’clock in the afternoon,
the bombardment of Étain began. Suspended for
some hours, it began again at nearly eleven p.m. and
lasted until two a.m. The results were frightful. The
next morning half the town was in ashes; the other
half was falling into ruins. The Red Cross hospital
in particular was aimed at. The first shell struck down
the white flag, while Dr. Proust was operating on the
wounded: the latter had to be hidden away in the cellars,
whence they were driven to Verdun (Report of Mme.
Paul, President of the Committee of the Association des
Dames Françaises at Étain).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<h3>Bombardment of Albert</h3>

<p>The bombardment of Albert took place on the 30th
August. We may judge how violent it was from a
photograph of the ruins which appeared in <i>L’Illustration</i>
for the 10th October. Whole streets disappeared, and
the whole Place d’Armes was demolished: the Germans
made a target of Notre Dame de Brébières, the basilica
which the inhabitants call the Lourdes of the North, and
to which so many pilgrimages make their way each
year. This church was completely ruined by the sacrilegious
fire expressly aimed at it, and the Statue of the
Miraculous Virgin which crowned it is to-day thrown
down and lies upon the ground. All around there
is nothing but building material that has fallen in,
half-burnt beams, charred walls, houses without roofs,
broken tiles, doors broken in, cut up by grapeshot.</p>

<h3>Bombardment of Nancy</h3>

<p>The French Commission of Inquiry, in its report,
published in the <i>Journal Officiel</i> of the 8th January,
1914, states that the capital of Lorraine was bombarded
“without previous warning during the night of the 9th
to 10th September. About sixty shells (continues this
report) fell on the central and southern-cemetery districts—that
is to say, on places where there is no military
defence. Three men, a young woman, and a little girl
were killed, thirty people were wounded, and serious
damage was done.”</p>

<p>“Enemy airmen flew over the town twice. On the
4th September one of them threw two bombs, one of
which killed a man and a little girl, and wounded six
people on the ‘Place de la Cathédrale.’ On the 13th
October three bombs were thrown on the goods station.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Four employees of the Eastern Railway Company were
wounded.”</p>

<h3>First Bombardment of Reims</h3>

<p>The story of the first bombardment of Reims was
told in the <i>Temps</i> of the 26th October by M. Henriot,
who had the opportunity of interviewing an influential
resident in the town.</p>

<p>On the 4th September, whilst Zimmer, head of the
German Stores Department, was negotiating the terms
of a levy to be paid by the village, a shell, says M.
Henriot, burst hard by.</p>

<p>“What was that explosion?” cried the German.
“You know you have no right to destroy anything.”
He thought that the French were blowing up some outwork.
Another shell disabused him. Then he thought
the French had begun to fire on the town in order to
drive the Germans. The local people undeceived him.
One of them ran out to the Place and brought back a
fragment of shell, which the commissary was compelled
to admit was a German missile. Then he was seen to
grow pale, nor could he understand how his own troops
should engage in such an attack. The white flag was
hoisted on one of the belfries of the cathedral: at the
same time Zimmer sent a motor to give the order to
cease firing. In the space of three-quarters of an hour
there fell upon the town 200 shells, which struck Saint-Remi
and Saint-André churches, broke down houses,
and killed sixty people. That was the first bombardment
of Reims, due, as was then believed, to a misunderstanding.
Zimmer expressed his regrets for it,
and cried in tones of wonder, “What a fine cathedral
you have!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<h3>Second Bombardment of Reims (<span class="why">18th to 20th September</span>)</h3>

<p>The bombardment of the 4th September took place
by order of General Bülow, as a reprisal for the disappearance
of two bearers of a flag of truce, MM. Armim
and Kimmer, who had been sent by him on the evening
before to Reims. On account of these two worthies,
who, without fulfilling their mission, had lost their way
in the French lines, the town found that it was threatened
with the execution of ten hostages, with bombardment,
and with a levy of 100 million francs. The second
bombardment took place some days afterwards under
circumstances of barbarism which will hold it up to the
execration of the ages. In the past history of Europe
there is nothing to compare with the destruction of the
Cathedral of Reims, save that of the Acropolis of Athens
by the Venetians. This cathedral was pitilessly bombarded
for two days (18th to 20th September): the
masterpiece of Gothic art, honoured by the coronation
of the kings of France, where Jeanne d’Arc put the
crown upon Charles VII in 1429, became the target of
destructive shells, hurled by the Vandals.</p>

<p>The following is a faithful account of this event,
telegraphed to the <i>Daily Mail</i> by the special correspondent
of that paper—</p>

<p>“By artillery fire deliberately aimed at the Cathedral
of Reims, the Germans set fire to and burnt the magnificent
building, which was not merely the pride of the
town, but an historic monument known and admired
by the entire world. Of this jewel of architecture
there remains only an empty shell, burnt and charred
walls. The impression left by this act of hideous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
vandalism will never leave the memory of those who
have had an opportunity of seeing these ruins.</p>

<p>“The sight of flames devouring a wonder which took
not less than 150 years to build, and which was respected
throughout numberless wars which took place in this
part of France, was one which both alarms and haunts
the mind. It seemed as if one were present at an attack
by some supernatural power, outside humanity: it was
like the vision of a work of hell.</p>

<p>“The fire began between four and five o’clock on
Saturday afternoon (19th September). All day shells
fell in the town. A whole district of the town, 100
metres in extent, was devoured by the fire, and in the
majority of streets only blazing houses and buildings
were to be seen.</p>

<p>“Even on the evening before (18th September) some
shells had accidentally struck the cathedral. On
Saturday morning the German batteries of Nogent
l’Abbesse, eight kilometres to the east of Reims, started
aiming at the cathedral. Shells discharged regularly
and without intermission made a breach in it. These
huge blocks of stone, which had resisted the storms of
several centuries, and might still have braved the
assaults of time, sank with a fearful crash like the roll
of thunder.</p>

<p>“At 4.30 the scaffolding on a part of the cathedral
where repairs were going on took fire. In a moment this
mass of woodwork and scaffolding began to blaze like
straw. Sparks falling on the roof carried the fire to the
old oak beams which support this part of the building.
Soon the roofs of the naves and the transepts were
nothing but a blazing brazier, and the flames darted out
and licked the towers. One of the burning beams fell
on a bed of straw which the Germans, as soon as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
occupied the town, had spread inside the cathedral to
lay their wounded on. At once the confessionals, the
chairs, and everything which happened to be inside the
building took fire.</p>

<p>“I had left Paris at midday and I had made a detour
round Meaux. I did not get as far as Reims until sundown.
It was too late to enter the town, but from the
hills which surround it, it was possible to get a still more
impressive view of the town than what I should have
been able to see in the streets themselves.</p>

<p>“From the gaping roof rose red fire and black smoke,
and the reflection of the flames glanced upon the glasswork.
At last the dead of night came on, but it was
not undisturbed for long. At two o’clock in the morning
the German batteries reopened fire. By day it is the
smoke of the shell which calls attention to the explosion.
By night the swift red flashes make a still more terrible
spectacle.</p>

<p>“The dawn came, grey and gloomy with a cold rain,
and when the shadows were dispelled and light at length
glimmered through the dismal leaden-coloured clouds,
which rose and brought the plain into view again, the
sight of the ravaged city with its ruined cathedral, the
walls of which smouldered among houses still in flames,
was a spectacle so dismal that the sun in his course can
have seen none more wretched in any quarter of the
world.”</p>

<h3>Damage to the Cathedral of Reims</h3>

<p>According to the report of the Commission of Inquiry,
which had as President the French Under-Secretary
for Fine Arts, and whose task was to prepare official
accounts of the damage done to the Reims Cathedral,
the following were the results of the bombardment—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“The cathedral was struck by about thirty projectiles
which, by actually striking the building or by
explosion, pulverised the stonework, smashed the glass,
and set fire to everything inflammable.</p>

<p>“Projectiles, fragments of which struck the whole
building, for the most part hit the upper part of the
north tower, smashing the corner of a turret, scraping
the face of the tower, and pressing so hard upon the
adjoining masonry as nearly to displace it; one of them
carried away the upper support of a flying buttress;
another smashed the stonework of some bays sloping
up to the tower; another broke up a staircase the steps
of which had been cut; still another knocked down part
of the balustrade of the principal façade under the
rose-window.</p>

<p>“The fire kindled by the shells caused the most
serious damage; no vestige of roof is to be seen over the
nave, the transepts, the choir, the apse, the aisles: only
some chapels kept their covering; but everything else
was reduced to ashes, the woodwork, the slates consumed;
everywhere lead melted and iron twisted.</p>

<p>“All this debris settled down beneath the vaulted
roofs, which, although they evidently suffered by contact
with the fire, were not broken in.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, the stonework close to the great
gallery at the top of the walls, and of the circular
galleries underneath the great glass work, was shattered
and charred.</p>

<p>“The belfry was devoured by the flames. The bells,
which fell on the lower roof without breaking it in, were
partly melted; the louvre-boards were untouched. The
flames started by the conflagration, driven over the
surfaces by the wind, completely defaced the stonework,
throwing down not only some of the statues which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
decorated the open entrance underneath this particular
tower, but also the copings of the arches which rise above
the door, crowned by a gable containing a representation
of the Crucifixion. The damage extends to the pinnacles
that rise above the buttresses as high as the gallery of
kings.</p>

<p>“The right side of this portal was less damaged;
the other portals were struck by fragments of
shells.</p>

<p>“In the interior, where German wounded had been
laid out on couches of straw, the fire splintered off the
moulding at the bases of the pillars in the nave, setting
fire to the tympana of the gates and even to the gates
themselves. This fire destroyed the statues placed in the
niches of the inner front, right and left of the door of
the south entrance. Finally, all the glasswork was
damaged by the explosion of projectiles and of splinters
which passed through them; half of the upper rose-window
and the open-work parts above the north and
south entrances were denuded of their stained glass;
the rose-window above the central entrance was only
riddled.</p>

<p>“To sum up, the cathedral was disfigured in its outlines
and in the details of its decoration; if its powerful
construction has partly sustained the shock of the projectiles,
its wonderful sculptures can never be replaced,
and it will bear for ever the imprint of a vandalism
beyond all imagination.”</p>

<p>“See also photographs of the burning cathedral in
<i>L’Illustration</i> (10th October, 1914. These photographs
are genuine historic documents. See also M. P. Gsell’s
account in the <i>Liberté</i> of the 24th September and Mr.
Bartlett’s in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, in <i>L’Illustration</i> of
the 26th).”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h3>Other Results of the Second Bombardment
of Reims (<span class="why">18th to 20th September</span>)</h3>

<p>The cathedral was not the only objective of the second
bombardment. Not only were several houses also
destroyed and several people killed, amongst others
Dr. Jacquin, who lived next door to the mayor, but the
Spanish consulate was bombarded, with the result that
several neutral subjects met their death, a fact which
was noted in a preceding chapter. The town hall,
the musée, the sub-prefecture (historic monuments all
of them) were almost wholly demolished. An auxiliary
hospital of the Société des Sœurs de l’Enfant-Jesus was
also cannonaded, and five Red Cross nurses were killed
and two others wounded at the bedside of the wounded
whom they had under their care.</p>

<h3>Fresh Bombardments of the Cathedral of
Reims (<span class="why">20th to 27th November</span>)</h3>

<p>After the 20th September, and in spite of the universal
indignation aroused by the outrage which they had
committed, the Germans continued the bombardment
of Reims without intermission. But it was not until
the last days of the month of November that the
cathedral suffered fresh damage.</p>

<p>On the 23rd November a shell struck and went right
through a bell-turret in the south tower at the top; on
the 27th another shell, falling between the south buttresses,
burst on the vault of the aisle. A third shell
which fell on the vaults above the south apse, brought
down a great deal of plaster in the church. A huge
shell, which fell to the right of the cathedral, a little
in front of the façade, damaged three statues over the
small entrance to the right which until then had escaped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
It was but one of many other calamities and one which
completed the ruin of an historic monument. After
the 20th November other shells destroyed a pinnacle,
a part of the upper gallery in the apse and a part of this
gallery beside the Salle des Rois.</p>

<p>Of the archbishop’s palace and the musées there
remain, in a word, only the walls.</p>

<p>As for the statues in the cathedral which appear
unharmed, they are burnt right through and crumble
away at the touch. The crime of the barbarians is
complete.</p>

<h3>The Bombardment of the Cathedral of
Reims is Inexcusable</h3>

<p>In the words of M. Delcassé, the French Minister of
Foreign Affairs, in the protest addressed by him to the
governments of neutral states on the morning after
the first bombardment, the Germans committed this
crime “without being able to appeal even to the appearance
of military necessity and for the mere lust of
destruction.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Germans tried to justify it by
alleging—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) That by means of strong entrenchments the
French had made Reims the chief corner-stone of
their defence, and thus forced Germans to attack
the town by every means.</p>

<p>(2) That by the order of the German higher command,
the cathedral was to be spared as long as
the enemy did not utilise it to his own advantage;
but in spite of the white flag which had been hoisted
upon it from the 20th September, the Germans
declared that there was on the cathedral towers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
an observation post which assisted the operations of
the French artillery.</p>

<p>(3) That as soon as this post was destroyed the
German field artillery ceased firing.</p>

<p>(4) That only the roof of the cathedral was burnt,
while the towers and the framework of the building
were uninjured. (This statement goes back to the
21st September and emanates from the German
chief headquarters.)</p>

<p>(5) Finally, that the fire was due to the scaffolding
erected in front of the cathedral to carry out
some repairs, and that when beams which had
caught fire had fallen on the roof, the French had
done nothing to put out the fire.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">These several excuses are worthless—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) General Joffre has formally declared that
“at no time did the military commandant of
Reims place any observation post on the towers
of the cathedral.”</p>

<p>(2) It was not on the 20th, but on the 4th
September, on the day of the first bombardment
of Reims by the Germans, that the white flag was
hoisted on the cathedral.</p>

<p>(3) One wants to know to what moment the
Germans assign the destruction of the alleged
observation post on the cathedral. According
to them, if this observation post had been
destroyed they would have stopped the bombardment.
Now, although for a long time every
observation post had been made impossible, the
fire still continued.</p>

<p>(4) The report, quoted above, of the Commission
des Beaux Arts, refutes the German assertion about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the seriousness of the damage caused up to the
evening of the 21st September.</p>

<p>(5) Do not let us forget to recall the fact that,
ten days before the bombardment, the German
censorship permitted the <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i> (of
the 8th September) to recommend respect for
French cathedrals, “especially that of Reims,
which is one of the finest in the world, which, since
the Middle Ages, has been especially dear to
Germans, since the master of Bamberg was inspired
by the statues on its portals to design several
of his figures, and which, like the other magnificent
churches of France, must be respected and
treated with veneration by the Germans, as was
the case with their fathers in 1870.” However,
the censorship did not prevent the appearance
of the sinister warning, three days previously,
in the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>, in these words: “The
western group of the Imperial Armies has already
passed the second line of forts, except Reims,
<i>whose royal splendour, dating from the time of the
white lily, will surely and soon crumble in the dust
under the strokes of our 420 howitzers</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The criminal responsibility of the commandant of
the German forces has, therefore, been proved in this
matter.</p>

<h3>Public Opinion throughout the World roused
to Indignation by the Bombardment of the
Cathedral of Reims</h3>

<p>It is difficult to describe the indignation roused
throughout all countries of the civilised world by the
bombardment of the cathedral of Reims. The newspapers
of the whole planet were its living mouthpieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>In Italy a number of learned institutions sent
protests, either to the French Embassy at Rome or
directly to the German authorities.</p>

<p>The Association of Artists, especially, held a reunion,
at which the most distinguished critics and artists of
Italy were present, and which passed unanimously a
resolution of protest.</p>

<p>The <i>Giornale d’Italia</i>, echoing the indignation of its
country, declared that “this act destroyed all the
ingenious and fertile excuses for Germany’s methods
of war,” and that “no act of reparation could wipe
out this act of purposeless barbarism, a crazy exhibition
of wounded vanity and ruffled pride.”</p>

<p>In Greece the newspapers were unanimous in
stigmatising German vandalism. <i>Nea Hellas</i> wrote:
“In the name of art, in the name of the Parthenon
half destroyed by the fire of the Venetian Morosini,
Greece, the mother of civilised nations, appeals to
belligerents to respect treasures of art, and asks the
Germans to cease to dishonour their country.”</p>

<p>In Spain the destruction of the cathedral of Reims
partly destroyed the long preparation of Spanish
opinion which had been carried on in favour of Germany.
The indignation of Spaniards was faithfully expressed
by an article in the <i>Libéral</i>, in which the following
words occur: “It seemed that the universal anathema
heaped upon the Germans after the destruction of
Louvain would have restrained their acts of unjustifiable
destruction. The Emperor appeared to feel
sorry in his letter of apologies addressed to the President
of the United States; but his soldiers surpassed
themselves, and the appalling barbarism of their
achievement is unexampled in history.”</p>

<p>Finally, in America not only the general public but
the Government were profoundly moved by the news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of the bombardment of one of the finest cathedrals in
the world. The American Consul at Lausanne was
instructed by his Government, on the day after the
crime, to go to Reims and make an inquiry on the spot.
As for American newspapers, the following are extracts
from them—</p>

<p>The <i>Tribune</i> said: “The destruction of the fine
monument of the Middle Ages is an act of vandalism
which puts German military methods on a level with
those of the Goths and the Huns. The crime of
destroying this venerable pile was committed by a
nation which claims that its mission is to impose its
civilisation on the rest of the world. By violating the
laws of war, Germany is encouraging other nations
to do the same.”</p>

<p>The <i>World</i> said: “Prussian militarism has outdone
everything previously seen in the category of vandalism.
Throughout the centuries, since the destruction of the
Parthenon, the world has known no such act.”</p>

<p>The <i>Sun</i> said: “In spite of the regrets which
Germany pretends to express, we cannot fail to draw
the conclusion that the cathedral of Reims was the
target of a deliberate attempt to destroy.”</p>

<h3>Bombardment of Gerbeviller</h3>

<p>The following are other examples of bombardments
at this period, which were carried out at places less
known, but in which the aim to destroy at any cost,
by any means, and in violation of every law stands no
less emphatically self-condemned. Of the picturesque
little village of Gerbeviller there remains only a heap
of stones, dust and ashes. The Germans bombarded
it mercilessly in the month of August. Possibly this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
bombardment was due to necessity, but the precise aim
of the German guns, posted in the outskirts of the
village, reveals the criminal design at work. The
village church was the chief object aimed at: it was
burnt down by shell fire, the pretty palatine chapel
demolished, and the château completely wiped out.</p>

<h3>Bombardment of Dompierre-aux-Bois</h3>

<p>On the 22nd September the Germans forced a way
into Dompierre-aux-Bois. They entered each house
with fixed bayonets, made all the men come out, and
then shut them up in the church. On the following
day it was the women’s and children’s turn, and so
these poor people found they were compelled to face
the fire of the German artillery which was let loose in
the village. Men, women, children and old folk were,
for five long days without ceasing, exposed to a rain
of bombs and shells.</p>

<p>On the 27th September the Germans lay in ambush
in the country behind Troyon so as to be able to fire
on the fort from which the French were bombarding
them. During the artillery duel which followed, the
Germans thought it well not to forget the wretched
people of Dompierre-aux-Bois, who were still shut up
in the church. About five p.m. they fired at the
church and a shell fell upon it. Forty persons were
killed or wounded by the hand of the same people who
forced them to stay in this spot, and who, from being
their gaolers, made themselves their executioners.</p>

<h3>Bombardment of Recquignies</h3>

<p>According to the evidence of Dr. Barbey (<i>Echo de
Paris</i> of the 20th January), the first German shells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
fired at Recquignies, in the beginning of the month of
September, were aimed at the brewery, which the
Red Cross flag upon it plainly marked as <i>a refuge
for the wounded</i>. Four inhabitants were killed and
two others were wounded.</p>

<h3>Bombardment of Soissons</h3>

<p>The town of Soissons was bombarded from the
13th to the 17th September almost without intermission.
The post office and the Grand Seminaire
are in ruins. The cemetery quarter of the town was
set on fire. Happily the cathedral suffered little.
But the Germans deliberately and with precise aim
fired at the hospital. This bombardment was without
any reason that could be admitted, for the town ought
to have been protected from artillery, as the Germans
occupied the hills to the north of the town when the
French troops had taken a position to the south-east
and did not discharge a single shell at it.</p>

<p>From the month of September the bombardment
of Soissons was interrupted: it began again in the
month of January. The Germans aimed their fire on
the hospitals, the ambulances, and especially on all
places where the wounded were gathered. During
the bombardment, which was carried on almost every
day in the month of January, the cathedral suffered
a great deal; it was reckoned that in eight hours
seventy-five shells of large calibre were fired at the
building. The entrance, the pulpit, and one of the
columns of the spire were ruined, and one of the bells
broken. On the 15th January a young girl was killed
in the Rue de la Barde, and many children fell victims
to German barbarism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<h3>Bombardment of Sampigny</h3>

<p>On the 15th September and the 8th October the
Germans, with the desire to wreak revenge, bombarded
the private residence of M. Poincaré, the President
of the French Republic. The second bombardment,
in the course of which forty-eight shells were discharged
at this residence, brought about its complete
destruction.</p>

<p>It is well to note that this destruction was nevertheless
denied by the Wolff agency, which declared
that the story was a myth, and added that if the site
upon which this residence stood had been burned, it
could only have been done by the French artillery itself.</p>

<h3>Bombardment of Arras</h3>

<p>The town of Arras was included, during the month
of October, in the theatre of military operations. The
Germans found a pretext for destroying it by two
bombardments, one on the 6th, the other on the 20th
and 21st October, which sowed destruction and death
in this town.</p>

<p>The first bombardment of Arras, which may be
compared to that at Reims, was meant to destroy the
town hall, a miracle of Flemish art, built at the beginning
of the seventeenth century, one of the finest
ornaments of northern France.</p>

<p>“On the 6th October, at six a.m.,” said the <i>Liberté</i>
of the 16th October, “the first shells fell near the
railway station. A little afterwards a bomb fell on
the roof of the town hall. All day long the guns
belched forth death, destruction and terror. The
inhabitants took refuge in the cellars, and even the
wretched wounded also had to be brought down into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
them, for, disregarding the Red Cross, the Germans
plied with machine-guns all the streets round the
town hall, in which there were several hospitals and
ambulances.</p>

<p>“The Hôpital St. Jean was the scene of a frightful
accident. A whole storey collapsed under the shells.
A nun and some wounded happened to be in the storey
below, and were buried underneath the ruins. It
was not possible to recover their bodies until the
evening, when the assassins of the Kaiser had ceased
bombardment.</p>

<p>“The musée, the cathedral, the Church of St. John the
Baptiste, the old Convent of the Holy Sacrament, with
its seventeenth-century campanile, and the Ursuline
belfry (a reproduction of the old reliquary of the Holy
Candle) were damaged. The shells fired at the
cathedral pierced its roof in two places and laid bare
the vault.”</p>

<p>The town hall alone was struck by nine-tenths of the
explosive shells thrown at Arras. Finally, the two
old towers, so stately and so peculiar in appearance,
which were all that was left of the old abbey founded
by Saint Eloi, in the village of that name near Arras,
were demolished by the Germans, who bombarded
them without any excuse, for the mere pleasure of
destruction.</p>

<p>The Germans cannot pretend that they did not
know the site of all these monuments, nor that of the
hospitals of Arras, for they had occupied the town one
day in the beginning of September. No more can they
allege that the French had made use of the quarter
destroyed by them for attack or for self-defence, for
this part of the town is in a hollow, which an army
would never try to utilise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the second bombardment of Arras (20th to
21st October), it was aimed at the belfry, the incomparable
monument of the town which alone remained
standing above the centre of the town hall. The
building fell on the 21st, at eleven a.m., having been
cut off close from the ancient roof of the structure
round about it.</p>

<h3>The Outrage on Notre-Dame of Paris</h3>

<p>German aeroplanes made frequent moves towards
Paris, of which we have already spoken. The outrage
of the 11th October, 1914, deserves special mention,
for this time the machine aimed at the cathedral. An
incendiary bomb was dropped on Notre-Dame. This
bomb set fire to one of the inner beams of the roof,
smashed six of the stays of the north transept, and
riddled with grapeshot the glass frame of the clock in
the same transept.</p>

<p>This outrage, coming after that at Reims, roused
fresh protests from neutral countries. The <i>Messagero</i>
of Rome (13th October) declared, and with reason,
that “the murder of peaceful citizens and the crime of
throwing bombs on Notre-Dame need no comment.”
These acts, the paper added, are a fresh crime against
humanity and against art for which the civilised world
will demand an account from the German people.</p>

<h3>Bombardment of Hazebrouck</h3>

<p>About the middle of November Hazebrouck suffered
bombardment by a German aeroplane: a bomb killed
a railway worker named Georges Demonvaux, and
wounded two other people. The aviator came a
second time, an hour afterwards, and threw three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
more bombs, aiming at the English and French Red
Cross hospitals, which, fortunately, were only slightly
injured.</p>

<p>Finally, to bring to an end the list of cruel bombardments,
let us put on record that of Houplines
(15th December), where fifty civilians were killed and
St. Paul’s Church was destroyed; those of Dunkirk
(24th December and 22nd January), where, besides the
murder of many civilians, the United States Consul
was wounded, and the consulates of the United States,
Norway and Uruguay were damaged. The hospital
was also struck by bombs. Finally, let us note the
bombardment of Béthune, which was carried on almost
without intermission, which caused the death of ten
people, and which was aimed at the hospital, in the
court of which a shell had fallen and burst.</p>

<p>The bombardment of Libau (in Courlande) is to be
added to the foregoing. On the 28th March a German
aeroplane caused the death of several persons and
wounded a little girl. Let us add also that of Calais,
where, quite recently, a Zeppelin damaged Notre-Dame
Church. A chapel of the latter, dedicated to the
Sacred Heart, had its vault broken in and its stained-glass
windows shattered. These were of great artistic
merit and represented scenes of the Crucifixion.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">KILLING OF THE WOUNDED BY GERMANS</span></h2>

<h3>The Wounded, the Red Cross, and the Geneva
Convention</h3>

<p>What is the aim and object of battles between belligerent
powers? To put out of action as large a number
as possible of enemy soldiers, and thus, as much as may
be, to break the enemy’s resistance. That, at least, is
the conception of the aim of war entertained by all
civilised nations, since only barbarians, from desire for
revenge, from blindness and brutality, would seek to do
injury for its own sake, and to seize the opportunity
of a state of war to gratify their instincts for plunder.
This conception, let us repeat, Germany, like all other
nations, has countersigned in solemn covenants.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the aims which this war is laying bare
in them are contrary to these pledges.</p>

<p>In fact, we see Germany deliberately killing either
those whom she could prevent from doing her any injury
by keeping them as prisoners, or even those who
were non-combatants. Some have thought that the
Germans aimed, in a manner, at the annihilation of
the race in nations hostile to Germany. It would be
dreadful if this were the case. As for ourselves, we
shall neither say that this has not been proved nor that
it is impossible. What is certain is that the number of
outrages committed by Germany can only be explained
by a deliberate attempt at barbaric destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond question they have attempted to damage the
property of the enemy. Pillage in their eyes has not
been one of the more or less inevitable concomitants
of war: it has been one of its deliberate aims. Moreover,
the policy of terrorisation is a part of their general plan
of action. In their view fear is a good ally of invasion,
and in order to reap all the advantage of it they have
left untried no form of violence or even of cruelty.</p>

<p>Besides, we are not here concerned with policy shaped
from above, by the Government or the higher command:
in the rank and file we may take everything for granted.
“Let us kill them all: there will be so many the fewer
left.” Who knows how often this monstrous thought
has entered the brain of people whose cruelty and violence
is a part of their plans of war? How often has it
not been a necessity to kill, as to sack, in order to overthrow,
to reduce, to weaken an enemy nation not merely
in war, but in general, and even as regards the future in
which rehabilitation might be anticipated. But civilised
nations look to treaties to prevent the rehabilitation of
the enemy. By looting and robbing industrial establishments,
the property of private individuals, the Germans
showed that their peculiar method was to try to prevent
it by war itself, to draw up a schedule of barbarism which
by its very nature endangers life itself, which includes
murder as well as pillage. Thus we understand how
the Germans, both in theory and practice, have violated
the most widely accepted conventions which, in the
midst of the havoc of war, limit the right to kill either
civilians or soldiers.</p>

<p>To begin with, the present chapter will be devoted
to the complete denial of the principles of humanity laid
down in the Geneva Convention. We reserve the right
of discussion in subsequent chapters of the questions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the treatment of prisoners, of the massacre of civilians,
etc. The violation of that part of the Convention of
Geneva which bears upon the wounded and the Red
Cross is, in fact, a deliberate crime, without any extenuating
circumstances; it is inexcusable and unpardonable.</p>

<p>What are the terms of the Convention of Geneva?
That “soldiers and other persons officially attached to
armies shall, when wounded or sick, <i>be respected and
taken care of</i> by the belligerent in whose power they may
be, without distinction of nationality.” The latter,
therefore, must look for and collect the sick and wounded,
and prevent every act by any third party which might
do them injury. These sick and wounded will be
prisoners of war, but “prisoners who must be taken care
of.” As for people attached to the Red Cross, it was
declared, and Germany and Austria-Hungary subscribed
both to this and to the preceding stipulations, that “the
<i>personnel</i> engaged exclusively in the collection, transport
and treatment of the wounded and sick, as well as in
the administration of medical units and establishments,
and the chaplains attached to armies, <i>shall be respected
and protected under all circumstances</i>; if they fall into
the hands of the enemy they shall not be treated as
prisoners of war.”</p>

<h3>Principles of the Geneva Convention which
Germans have violated</h3>

<p>We have already stated in the preceding chapter how
seldom the Germans have carried out these principles,
for, contrariwise, they have deliberately aimed their
artillery at establishments for the shelter of the wounded,
the sick, and the hospital services. This fact is not the
only one which shows the contempt displayed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Germans for the Geneva Convention. It seems that
they have eagerly seized upon every opportunity which
presented itself to violate this convention in every way.
Not only have the wounded who fell into their hands
not been properly treated by them, but in many instances
these wounded have been put to death. Sometimes,
before killing them, they treated themselves to
the enjoyment of making them suffer. It is scarcely
credible, but it is true, that in more than one case the
killing of the wounded assumed the form of a command
issued by the officers themselves. We have said that the
Germans have also fired on ambulances. They have
killed and ill-treated Red Cross nurses, male and female,
and the doctors engaged on Red Cross work.</p>

<h3>Killing of the Wounded ordered by Officers</h3>

<p>The German wounded are many. It followed, therefore,
that the German medical service was disinclined
to encumber itself with relays of enemy wounded.
Perhaps this is also the reason why orders were given
to the soldiers to kill the wounded. General Stenger
issued, on the 26th August, an order of the day <i>giving
instructions to make no more prisoners and to leave no
living man behind</i>. The authenticity of this order, the
full text of which we give in the next chapter, was
confirmed by the evidence of German prisoners.</p>

<p>The prisoners cross-examined, says the <i>Temps</i>, which
reported the depositions, belong to the 112th and 142nd
infantry regiments. They were put on oath and signed
the report of their examination. A soldier of the 142nd
deposed that, on the 26th August, about three o’clock,
he was in the van of his battalion in the forest of
Thiaville when <i>the company order giving instructions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
kill the wounded was sent along the ranks and repeated
from man to man</i>.</p>

<p>This prisoner added that as soon as this order was
passed round, ten or twelve French wounded who were
lying here and there round about the battalion were
dispatched with rifle shots.</p>

<p>Another prisoner in the same regiment deposed that,
on the 26th August, he saw a cavalry officer, unknown
to him, <i>come and give the order in question as coming from
headquarters</i>. Immediately afterwards rifle shots were
heard coming from the head of the detachment in front
of him.</p>

<p>A soldier of the 112th declared that he heard, on the
26th August, <i>Captain Curtins, in command of the 3rd
Company</i>, say that henceforth no more wounded were
to be made prisoners. Shortly afterwards he heard
rifle shots fired at the French wounded who happened
to be lying along the roads.</p>

<p>Another soldier of the 112th gave evidence that on the
same day, between four and five o’clock, <i>some French
wounded</i> who happened to be on the sides of the road
from Thiaville to Saint Benoit, <i>were killed by order of
the commander of the 1st battalion</i>.</p>

<p>About twenty German soldiers who were cross-examined
admitted that this order had been given, but
without giving details about the manner in which it
had been carried out. Some prisoners, who did not
know even in the field about the company order of the
day, declared that they were subsequently informed of
it by their comrades.</p>

<p>Moreover, the German soldier Karl Johannes Kaltenochner
(9th company of the regiment of Count Bülow
of Tervuenwist), who deserted and took refuge in
Holland, declared in the <i>Telegraaf</i> of Amsterdam (<i>Temps</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of 3rd January, 1915) that when Turcos were made
prisoners the German officers did not take the trouble
to send them to any place behind the lines, <i>and gave
orders to the soldiers to shoot them</i>. He quoted <i>Major
Botwitz as having given orders to kill two Turco prisoners</i>.
It is not, then, to be wondered at that the soldier who
made this disclosure accompanied it with the declaration
“that the German soldiers have become like wild
animals and think only of killing and pillaging.”</p>

<p>Finally, in the hospital at Nancy two German soldiers
who were under treatment there made similar confessions.
One of them, who had a wound in the stomach,
confided to <i>Dr. Rohmer that it had been caused by a
revolver-shot from his officer, because he declined to kill a
wounded Frenchman</i>. The other, who was wounded
in the back by a shot fired point-blank, declared to
Dr. Weiss that, <i>in obedience to the order of an officer</i>, a
soldier had fired on him to punish him for having carried
several wounded Frenchmen into a village not far from
the battlefield.</p>

<h3>French and Belgian Officers killed by
the Germans</h3>

<p>The number of officers killed by Germans on the
different battlefields to which the war has extended is
certainly greater than one would think. The following
are two attested instances—</p>

<p>On the 9th August, at Ormael in Belgium, the Belgian
Commandant Knapen, who was already wounded, was
killed.</p>

<p>On the 12th August, after the battle of Haelen in
Belgium, the Germans killed, by a revolver-shot in
the mouth, Commandant Van Daume, who had been
seriously wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 22nd August, at Gommery (Belgian Luxemburg)
M. Charles Deschars, former commercial attaché
of France at Berlin, was killed under the following disgraceful
circumstances. M. Deschars, an interpreter
lieutenant at the headquarters of General Trentinian,
had been wounded at the battle of Elbe, in Belgian
Luxemburg, on the 22nd August. On that day he had
to be left at an ambulance in the village of Gommery.
In the evening came a German troop belonging to the
47th infantry regiment, in command of a non-commissioned
officer. The latter pretended that a shot had
been fired at his platoon. He asked for an interpreter,
and M. Ch. Deschars came down, helped by attendants.
<i>He went up to the German non-commissioned officer, and
the latter, after exchanging some words with him, drew a
revolver and blew out his brains.</i></p>

<p>After this murder the German platoon gave itself up
to all sorts of excesses. Dr. Vaissières, who happened
to be in the ambulance, was killed. Dr. Sedillot,
surgeon-major of the 1st class, was wounded. The
majority of the wounded were killed.</p>

<p>A similar crime took place during an engagement
between French dragoons and German light cavalry.
A French lieutenant, who afterwards told the story in
the <i>Matin</i> of the 22nd August, finding he was wounded,
called for help. A German came up and, seeing that he
had to deal with an officer, appealed to his commandant,
M. de Schaffenberg, of the Trèves light cavalry. The
latter went behind the French lieutenant, took his
cavalry revolver, and at point blank shot him in the
stomach. The French officer’s orderly was spared only
because Commandant de Schaffenberg thought he was
dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<h3>Wounded Soldiers tortured before being
put to Death</h3>

<p>The German crime of killing enemy wounded assumes
a still more dreadful aspect when it is committed only
after the victims have suffered cruel treatment. The
tortures inflicted on the wounded argue an exceptional
ferocity in those who are guilty of them, and yet such
cases are not rare.</p>

<p>On the 16th August, at Dinant, French soldiers were
found with their heads smashed in by the butt-ends of
rifles. On the 25th August, at Hofstade in Belgium, a
soldier who had been slightly wounded was also killed
by blows from the butt-end of a rifle. In a wood not far
from the road to Malines, at Tervueren, eighteen Belgian
riflemen were killed by bayonet thrusts in the head. One
of the French wounded, who had been taken again by
the French troops and then left at Besançon, had been
struck on the head and sides with blows from the butt-end
of a rifle and kicked. A German soldier had dragged
him along the ground. Beside him another wounded
Frenchman was dispatched with bayonet thrusts. The
Belgian quartermaster Beaudin van de Kerchove
(5th lancers), who had been wounded by two German
bullets at the battle of Orsmael, on the 20th August, was
also tortured. The French sergeant Lemerre, who had
been wounded in the leg at Rembercourt by a bursting
shell, was left on the ground for eight days by the
German ambulance, who had, however, seen him. On
the fourth day, on the order of an officer who, revolver
in hand, was crossing the field of battle, this non-commissioned
officer was wounded again by a rifle shot fired
by a soldier.</p>

<p>The French Commission of Inquiry on their part quote
three cases of torture inflicted on the wounded—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“On the evening of the 25th August,” say the
Commission in their report, the Abbé Denis, Curé of
Reméreville, tended Lieutenant Toussaint, who had
only left the forestry school in the previous month of
July. As he lay wounded on the field of battle, this
young officer had been bayoneted by all the Germans
who had passed by him. His body was one great
wound from head to foot.</p>

<p>“At the Nancy hospital we saw Private Voger of the
infantry regiment, who was still bearing the marks of
German barbarism. Seriously wounded in the spinal
column, in front of the forest of Champenoux, on the
24th August, and paralysed in both legs as a result of
his wound, he had remained lying on his stomach, when
a German soldier brutally turned him over with his
rifle and struck him three times with the butt on the
head. Others, who were passing near him, also struck
him with the butt-ends of their rifles and kicked him.</p>

<p>“Finally, one of them with a single stroke made a
wound below and three or four centimetres from each
eye with the help of an instrument which the victim
could not distinguish, but which in the opinion of
Dr. Weiss, chief physician and professor of the faculty
of Nancy, must have been a pair of scissors.”</p>

<p>These facts appear difficult of belief. Nevertheless
a confession of similar deeds has been made by German
soldiers; for example, Paul Gloede, of the 9th battalion
of Pioneers (9th corps), actually writes in his notebook:
“Mutilation of the wounded is the order of the day.”</p>

<h3>Published Admission by Germans</h3>

<p>These acts of German troops did not always make
Germans ashamed. On the contrary, in certain cases
they even thought it was a clever thing to boast about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
it. For instance, a story, which had come from the
German non-commissioned officer Klemt (154th infantry
regiment, 1st company), was published in a
newspaper of Jauer in Silesia on the 18th October, 1914.
The paper even put as a marginal note the following
phrase “<i>The 24th September, 1914, a day of honour for
our troops.</i>” In his pamphlet, <i>German Crimes according
to German Evidence</i>, M. Bédier has put on record the
non-commissioned officer’s story.</p>

<p>“We bludgeon and transfix the wounded,” says the
wretch, “for we know that these scoundrels, when we
have passed by, would fire at our backs. There lies
at full length a Frenchman, face to the ground, but he
is shamming death. A kick from the foot of a stout
fusilier lets him know that we are there. Turning
round, he asks for quarter, but we say to him, ‘That
is how, you ⸺, your tools work,’ and we pin him
to the ground. Beside me, I hear strange crashing
noises. They are blows from the butt-end of a rifle
which a soldier of the 154th regiment is vigorously
applying to a Frenchman’s bald head: very cleverly
he used a French rifle for his work, lest he should break
his own. Men with exceptionally tender hearts do the
French wounded the favour of finishing them off with
a bullet, but others distribute as many cuts and thrusts
as they can. Our opponents had fought bravely: they
were picked troops whom we had in front of us: they
let us come as close as thirty and even ten metres to
them: too close. Knapsacks and arms thrown in a heap
prove that they wanted to take to flight, but at sight of
the ‘grey phantoms,’ terror paralysed their limbs, and
on the narrow path which they were taking the German
bullet brought them the order to ‘halt.’ At the
entrance to their hiding-place of boughs of trees they lie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
groaning and asking for quarter. But, whether they
were lightly or seriously wounded, the fusiliers spare the
fatherland the expensive attentions which would have
to be given to a crowd of enemies.”</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officer adds that Prince Oscar
of Prussia, on being informed of the exploits of the
154th and of the regiment which with the 154th forms
a brigade, declared they were both worthy of the name
“King’s Brigade.” “When evening came,” he continued,
“with a prayer of thanks upon our lips we fell
asleep in expectation of the following day.” Then,
having added by way of postscript a little bit of
verse, “Return from Battle,” he brings the whole,
prose and verse, to his lieutenant, who countersigns it,
“Certified to be correct, De Niem, lieutenant and
company commander.”</p>

<h3>German Murder of People attached to the
Medical Service and the Red Cross</h3>

<p>No more than the wounded were people engaged in
tending or transporting the wounded spared by the
Germans.</p>

<p>We have said that in bombardments no distinction
was made between Red Cross establishments and the
others. But even outside these cases the Geneva
Convention was so frequently violated that we are
driven to attach no credence to the excuses invented
in case of bombardment.</p>

<p>Enemy doctors, nurses male and female, ambulance
workers have been often ill-treated, wounded and even
killed by the Germans. We have noted one case, in
reporting the murder of the French lieutenant Deschars
who had been previously wounded. It is not the only
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Pierre Nothomb reports several in his pamphlet,
<i>Belgique Martyre</i>. We must also remember the testimony
given by Dr. Barbey (<i>Echo de Paris</i> of the
20th January, 1915). Speaking of the cruelties committed
by the Germans at Recquignies (Nord), this
doctor says—</p>

<p>“On the afternoon of the 6th September German
soldiers came to the ambulance; they were very much
excited: two of them caught hold of me brutally and
another presented his rifle at me. I explained to them
that they were in a temporary hospital, where there
were no arms, which was true, and, moreover, all arms
had been punctiliously given up by the civilians at the
beginning of the siege. The Boches searched everywhere
without finding anything. Then they went off,
leading the eight attendants and stretcher-bearers,
whom, as they pretended, they needed to bring their
wounded to Boussois. The little company set out.
As they were passing before my house, which was still
uninjured, the Germans, revolver in hand, compelled
attendant Jus to set fire to it. They did the same with
the mayor’s house, which was next door to mine.</p>

<p>“On the way back from this expedition, as the eight
attendants, who all the time had been surrounded by
Boches, were going along the railway-line from Paris
to Cologne, the leader of the detachment suddenly
caused a halt: the French soldiers were lined along
the bank: they were ordered to raise their arms and
they obeyed.</p>

<p>“‘Shoot them,’ commanded the leader. A volley
rang out. The eight men fell. Without troubling
further about them the bandits went off at once,
shouting, for they were drunk… Fortunately, so
drunk, in fact, that their bullets had nearly all missed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Only four of our attendants were wounded: Private
Hacrien; Private Caudren, who had his leg broken; a
private who was a native of Perenchies, and who had
a bullet through his thigh, and a fourth private who
sustained a not very serious wound on the knee. When
the Boches were gone the four attendants, who were
unhurt and who had been shamming death, lifted up
their comrades and brought them to the ambulance.</p>

<p>“On the following day all the wounded under
treatment in this ambulance were brought, without
food, to Beaumont in Belgium, where a kindly major
had them collected in a convent which had been transformed
into a hospital. There I left them, as I had
been authorised to go back alone to France.</p>

<p>“I set out on foot, without a copper, on an empty
stomach. On the way, I met with a German patrol;
without parley, the savages belaboured me with the
butt-ends of their rifles and left me for dead, having
just stripped me of all I had left—namely, my
clothes.”</p>

<p>M. Herriot, Mayor of Lyon, on his part, in a letter
to a French minister, declares that “he knows ten
French doctors whose ambulances had been bombarded
and their attendants killed,” and that “<i>the Chief Rabbi
of Lyon was killed as he was endeavouring to get the
wounded out through the window of an ambulance which
had been set on fire by shells</i>.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the French Commission of Inquiry
states in its report that, on the 25th August, at Einvaux
some Germans had opened fire at 300 metres on Dr.
Millet, surgeon-major of the colonial regiment, just
when, with the help of two bearers, he was dressing
the wounds of a man who was lying on a stretcher. As
his left side was turned to them they saw his brassard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
perfectly. Besides, they could not have been mistaken
about the kind of job on which the three men were
engaged.</p>

<p>“At Xivry-Circourt,” writes M. Bonne, senior curé
of Étain, in a report which he drew up, “the Germans
seized an ambulance and a convoy of wounded, only
the first carriage of which succeeded in escaping, in a
hail of bullets.”</p>

<p>In a report on the outrages and crimes committed by
the Germans at Arras, M. Briens, prefect of the Department
of Pas de Calais, remarks: “The most painful
feelings have been roused by the taking away of all
the wounded under treatment at the hospitals whom
it was possible to carry… The surgeon-majors of
the Medical Service and the Red Cross attendants
were attached to this convoy of prisoners.”</p>

<p>Finally, before Lunéville, a French Red Cross
nurse, Mme. Prudennec, while on the look-out for
wounded on the battlefields, tended a <i>German officer
who, to show his gratitude, gave her a sabre thrust in
return</i>. The nurse was injured in the leg, and for
five days remained wounded in the hands of the Prussians.
But when the time came for them to retreat
the Germans left behind the nurse (who was unable to
walk), and so it came to pass that she was saved by
French soldiers.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">ILL-TREATMENT OF PRISONERS OF WAR</span></h2>

<p>By common consent good treatment of prisoners of
war is a law imposed on civilised nations. American
instructions, in their article 56, do but put into words
the feelings of civilised mankind when they say, “A
prisoner of war must suffer no penalty in so far as he
is a public enemy; no suffering, no dishonour will be
intentionally imposed upon him by way of reprisal,
neither imprisonment, nor deprivation of food, nor
mutilation, nor death, nor any barbarous treatment.”
Such is the line of conduct which belligerents long
have followed in this matter; such is the idea they
entertain of their duty in war.</p>

<h3>The German Idea</h3>

<p>In the present war, however, we have seen the
Germans change all that: in this respect, as in so many
others, they have shown unmitigated contempt for
current conceptions of war. They have been seen to
vent their hatred and desire for vengeance upon a
prisoner. Therein is the reaction of a feeling of cruel
pride. Have not the prisoners of war who fall into
German hands committed the crime of offering resistance
to the actions of the first people in the world?
Consequently, M. Pierre Nothomb remarks, in his book,
<i>Belgique Martyre</i>, “in the hands of the German
a prisoner is not a soldier who has been unlucky,
but a victim who is to endure his hatred.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Germany took good care not to advertise this principle.
It would have been too open a violation of the
law of nations, and, besides, it would have exposed
her to reprisals. Prisoners who surrendered in a body
were spared up to a certain point. But the case was
different with prisoners taken in little groups. Towards
them, because their fate was more obscure,
and the manner in which they were treated might
appear to involve less responsibility for the whole
system, no ill-treatment and cruelty, from insults to
death, were omitted. They were jeered at, and from
mockery their tormentors went on to blows and
wounds.</p>

<h3>Blows</h3>

<p>At Camperhout (in Belgium) the Germans amused
themselves with imposing on the prisoners fatigue-duty,
in the course of which the latter were struck on
the slightest pretext. A Greek, who was a volunteer
in the French army, has told what happened, in a
letter to the <i>Nea Himera</i> at Athens. “There were
eight hundred prisoners of us, five of whom were Greeks.
We were brought before German officers, who ordered
us to undress. Then they had us tied with ropes and
whipped by six German soldiers.”</p>

<p>They were undressed and stripped of what they had.
“When I was able to get my clothes again,” said the
same witness, “I found that a sum of 3850 francs and
an old gold medal had disappeared.”</p>

<h3>Cross-examination</h3>

<p>At the same time that vengeance was being taken
on the prisoners, attempts were made to extract from
them information which would be useful for carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
on the war. They were questioned as to what they
had seen, as to the enemy forces and the positions
occupied by them, and in general on all military or
strategic questions on which they might be supposed
to have knowledge, as an hour previously they had
been in the trenches. Sometimes, in order to obtain
information like this, they were content to resort to
a ruse; on other occasions they went as far as threats
followed by actions.</p>

<p>Despicable German officers dared to cross-examine
prisoners whom they had just made. Brought bound
before the officers, the prisoners found they were
ordered to reply under penalty of being tortured and
killed. Near Aerschot, a Belgian soldier, who had
been made a prisoner, understood that he was asked
in this manner, by an officer and three soldiers, where
were his regiment and the body of his troops. This
soldier, who had refused to reply, was thrown to the
ground, kicked, and finally abandoned, still tied with
ropes.</p>

<p>On the 29th March the Germans took prisoner, north
of Mychinetz, a Russian non-commissioned officer,
Paphyre Panasiouk, and tortured him in the presence
of ten German officers, who tried to drag information
from him about the positions of the Russian troops.
Having refused to act as a traitor to the advantage
of his enemies, the wretched non-commissioned officer
had the lobe of his right ear cut off by a German officer,
who then, in four strokes, cut off the top of the ear,
leaving only a piece of cartilage round the auricular
passage. In the meantime, another officer was mutilating
his nose, separating the cartilage from the bone,
and biting him. This torture lasted for a whole hour,
and the victim, who afterwards succeeded in giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
his guards the slip, was placed in hospital at Warsaw,
where the doctors photographed his mutilated face.</p>

<h3>Murders</h3>

<p>In other places prisoners were shot. In an official
note of the Russian Government, a German officer
was mentioned by name as having formally given
the order to hang all Cossacks who should be made
prisoner. This was Major Modeiski, of the German
cuirassiers. In confirmation of the fact, it was stated
that in many places Cossack prisoners had been
hanged, shot or killed by bayonet thrusts; at Radom,
in the middle of October, an officer and four Cossacks;
at Ratchki, a Cossack; at Monastijisk, four Cossacks;
at Tapilovka, the Cossack Jidkof, who had been made
prisoner at Souvalki, etc.</p>

<p>At Chabatz, sixty Serbian soldiers, who had been
made prisoner, were massacred, and in the Belfort
region a large number of French prisoners were undressed
by the Germans, who exposed them naked to
French bullets, and threw others into the canal, only
to take them out again and throw them in once more.</p>

<p>At Namur, during the retreat, Parfonnery, an infantryman,
was made prisoner with a group of soldiers.
“Their hands were tied behind their backs, they were
bound together four by four; they were compelled
to march all day, being struck with the flat of the sword
and the butt-end of the rifle, and finally were thrown
into the cellars of the Château Saint-Gérard.” Elsewhere
another Belgian prisoner, who rebelled against
this ill-treatment, had his neck twisted by his guards.</p>

<p>At Dixmude, Lieutenant Poncin (of the 12th Belgian
Regiment of the Line) was shot after having been bound
round the middle by a wire tied about ten times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
round his legs. On the 6th September a Belgian
cavalryman, who had been made prisoner, was disarmed,
then bound and had his bowels opened with
bayonet thrusts. Near Sempst the Germans opened
the bowels of two Belgian carabineers and pulled out
their entrails; at Tamine the Germans tied a French
officer to the trunk of a tree and harnessed horses to
each of his legs. By forcing the horses to run, the
wretched man was torn asunder. These latter facts
are reported in M. Pierre Nothomb’s book. At Saenski
(in the Souvalki area) a Cossack was burnt alive on the
first of October. Other Russian prisoners also were
condemned to die of hunger. In other places Cossacks
were condemned to dig their graves and were shot.</p>

<h3>German Admissions</h3>

<p>In September 1914, when the Russians were forced
to evacuate eastern Prussia before the advancing
Germans, they had recourse to what was an indisputable
right by making unusable such provisions as they
could not carry away. In this way enormous quantities
of bread were wet with petrol by orders from headquarters,
so that the enemy could get no advantage
from it. The <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i> of the 8th October
recorded this act as a crime which deserved punishment.
Under the heading “A Just Punishment,”
this paper had the hardihood to tell of the vengeance
which the Germans enacted for it. The stores were
at Insterbourg. The Russians, wrote the <i>Frankfurter
Zeitung</i>, had reckoned without General Hindenburg’s
sense of humour. When this general was informed
of the matter, he said, “There is no accounting for
tastes. The Russians have their tastes. <i>This bread
will do to feed Russian prisoners of war until these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
provisions are exhausted.</i>” Let us not forget to notice
the style of this article. This expression of the most
cruel wrath, and of the keenest thirst for vengeance,
is called “humour.” And in what journal? In one
of the most influential and most moderate organs in
Germany. There can be no more striking admission
both of the acts of cruelty and of the barbaric passion
which instigated them.</p>

<p>A perusal of the confession of these abominations,
a confession, too, made in such terms, gives a better
idea of the character and aims of this nation.</p>

<p>General Stenger, to whom we have already referred,
the commander of the 38th Brigade, gave instructions
for the massacre of the wounded in an order of the
day which we reproduce verbatim, and which is so
abominable that it is beyond criticism.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>From to-day, there will be no more prisoners made.
All prisoners will be massacred. Even prisoners who
have already been arranged in convoys will be massacred.
Behind us no enemy will be left alive.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Stoy</span>, Lieutenant and Commander-in-Chief of the
Company.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Neubauer</span>, Colonel in command of the Regiment.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Stenger</span>, General in command of the Brigade.”</p>

</div>

<p>M. Bédier has reproduced in his book the actual
original of this document.</p>

<h3>Treatment of Prisoners in Germany</h3>

<p>Once they had left the battlefields for the German
fortresses, where they were to be kept under guard,
it was inevitable that prisoners of war should be exposed
to the most brutal ill-treatment, death, wounds
and blows. A regular prison regimen following upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
possible outrages on the field of battle would, of course,
absolutely prevent that. But all the penalties which
the prisoners could possibly be made to suffer under
these new circumstances were heaped upon them in
profusion. They were not allowed to have their
letters; customs duties were imposed on the packages
sent to them from their own country, and the transmission
of these packages was irregular and uncertain;
finally, some of these consignments were constantly
and systematically looted.</p>

<p>The French Government complained. In fear of
reprisals the Germans had to alter their ways, though
in some respects they continued as before. They
refused to sanction the pay of private soldiers and
non-commissioned officers, who had been taken
prisoner; they fixed the pay of inferior and superior
officers at the ridiculous amounts of sixty and a
hundred marks; they refused to serve out allowances
of tobacco and cruelly cut short the supply of food.</p>

<p>These measures are significant. They show Germany’s
view of the prisoner of war. The only favour
she allows him is not to kill him, not to beat him, not
to let him die outright of hunger. We speak here of
orders given and measures taken by the higher command,
for which no excuse that pleads the inhumanity
of war could be admitted.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MURDER, TORTURE AND VIOLATION OF WOMEN IN
INVADED TERRITORY</span></h2>

<p>The present and following chapters will contain the
most abominable part of this indictment. We shall
read the story of outrages of which women have been
made victims by the German scoundrels. Were not
these outrages, established as they are by certain
reports, and confirmed by confessions which the Germans
themselves have inadvertently made, the result
of the unbridled instincts of an army in a state of
delirium? We should like to think so, but the details
to hand with regard to the circumstances under which
these acts were performed compel us to recognise that
something more is involved in them. They reveal
the presence of cruelty and thirst for innocent blood
in the perpetrators of these murders and acts of
violence.</p>

<p>Crimes committed against octogenarian old women
seem to issue from a special hatred, directed against
those who gave birth to their enemies of to-day. The
number of acts of violation committed by these invaders
proves that there is inherent in the German
mind a peculiar contempt for all human laws, a regular
bestiality, a cynical audacity, which, if the reins are
given to it, borders on madness.</p>

<p>In the performance of these abominable acts the
Germans showed no trace of humanity. Their thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
were incapable of going back to themselves and their
fatherland, to the daughters, the fiancées, the wives,
the mothers whom they themselves had left at home;
wholesale murders, mutilations, tortures, treatment so
frightful as to drive the victims crazy, refinements of
cruelty by which the relatives and parents of the latter
were made partners in their punishment, and in which,
as we have seen, neither organisation nor method was
wanting—such are the acts of which we are about to
give proofs and examples.</p>

<h3>Murders</h3>

<p>In the story of the murders committed by the
Germans, of which women have been the victims, we
see almost always that these were surprised in the
midst of their common daily tasks. The horror of
the crime committed against them is enhanced. It
is still worse when the massacred women were about
to perform some act of charity. At Tamines, in
Belgium, a woman was killed in the middle of the
street as she was carrying a sick old man. At Mayen-Multien
a woman named Laforest was seriously
wounded, in the beginning of September, by a German
horseman to whom she and her husband had been
obliged to give hospitality. His excuse was that they
were too long about serving him. At Hazebrouck,
in the middle of the month of October, a German
soldier, who was riding a bicycle, seeing in a corner
a poor mother seated with her child sleeping on her
knees, transfixed the latter with his bayonet, and at
the same time wounded the mother in the thigh,
without any of his comrades interfering. At Audun-le-Roman,
Mlle. Tréfel was struck at the very moment
when she was giving a drink to a German soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Examples of such acts are innumerable. The most
striking instances were those which took place at
Malines, Gerbeviller, Audun-le-Roman, Boortmeerbeck,
Neuville-en-Artois, Hériménil. At Hériménil,
Mme. Truger, twenty-three years old, was shot by order
of an officer. At Boortemeerbeck, the maid-servant
of Mlle. van Hoorde was killed because she was
accused of having assassinated an officer. This officer
had committed suicide, after leaving on his table a
letter in which he declared his intention. At Lunéville
a young girl of sixteen years, Mlle. Weill, was
killed in her own house by her father’s side.</p>

<p>In the same town a woman aged ninety-eight years
was killed in her bed and thrown into the flames;
at Triaucourt, Mme. Maupoix, aged seventy-five years,
was so violently kicked that she died some days afterwards.
Two other old women of the same place were
shot dead. During the following night the Germans
played the piano near the corpses. At Nomény several
women were forced to make a long march on foot; an
old woman, who was just on the verge of a hundred
years, fell down in a state of exhaustion and died.
At Hofstade, another old woman was found dead by
the Belgian soldiers. She had been bayoneted several
times as she sat down to sew. At Gerbeviller, widow
Guillaume, aged sixty-eight years, was killed by a
shot fired point-blank.</p>

<h3>Wholesale Murder</h3>

<p>In many cases the Germans went as far as general
massacres. The excuse invoked by them was a
pretended right of reprisals.</p>

<p>The most appalling of these butcheries seems to
have been that of Dinant, which took place on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
22nd August and following days. “In these terrible
days,” writes a Dutchman, M. Staller, on this topic,
in the <i>Telegraaf</i> (translated in the <i>Temps</i>, 19th December,
1914), “at Dinant and also in the neighbouring
villages of Anseremme, Leffe and Neffe, more than
eight hundred persons were killed, amongst whom
there were many women and children.” The <i>XX Siècle</i>
published the names of about sixty women, several
of whom were octogenarians, and of about forty
children. The excuse put forward was that three
German soldiers had been killed by the civilians
(see further on).</p>

<p>“At Anseremme,” continues the <i>Telegraaf</i>, “eighteen
women and two children were concealed under a
bridge; the soldiers caught sight of them and fired
with a machine-gun until there was no more sign of
life; on the following morning they burnt the corpses,
probably that they might not be accused of having
killed defenceless people. I saw the horrible remains
of the fire.”</p>

<p>Another massacre was that witnessed at Louvain.
On the 27th August, at 8 o’clock, the order was given
to the inhabitants of Louvain to leave the town, as
it was going to be bombarded. Amongst these thousands
of wretched people, pursued by the brutal
soldiers, were large numbers of women, and some,
who had not the strength to follow the procession,
were shot.</p>

<h3>Tortured Women</h3>

<p>A humane reader cannot repress a tremor as he
learns the story of the tortures inflicted on women by
the Germans on several occasions. We should have
spared our readers these stories, were it not necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to pay special attention to them for the purpose of
showing how far German barbarism can go.</p>

<p>At Dompierre-aux-Bois, after the bombardment
which we have described, the Germans did not want
to allow the people shut up in a church which they
were bombarding even to go to look for water to
tend the wounded. Women were compelled to wait
without help, wounded, bruised, mutilated under the
eyes of their parents, who were powerless to help them
during a time of agony which for some lasted up to
twenty-four and thirty-six hours. When they were
dead, the Germans forced the men to dig a grave near
the cemetery and to bury them in it. One of them
found that in this way he was forced to bury without
a coffin his wife, her mother and her sisters.</p>

<p>At Révigny the French Commission of Inquiry notes
the case of a woman who was found killed in a cellar,
with her breast and right arm cut off. Her little son,
aged eleven years, also had a foot cut off.</p>

<p>M. Bonne, the senior curate of Étain, declares in his
report that a woman of Audun-le-Roman, who was
suckling her child, was tortured for refusing to give
the enemy food. They mangled her abdomen and
killed her child.</p>

<p>At Sempst, in Belgium, a woman was bayoneted,
covered with petrol, and thrown into the flames. The
fact is noted in the second report of the Belgian Commission
of Inquiry. M. Pierre Nothomb relates the
following facts: “On coming to Averbode, on the
20th August, the Germans saw a woman, who—seized
with fear—concealed herself in a ditch. They killed
her with lance-thrusts. An hour’s journey from there,
at Schaffen, they disembowelled a young girl of twenty
years. Peasants from the outskirts of Louvain went
to Antwerp, on the 12th September, and told that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Wilzele the Germans wanted to burn alive Mme.
Van Kriegelinen and her eleven children. The
woman and eight children were burnt. We saw the
corpses of the mother and her children, and were
present at the execution.” The volunteer gunner
de R⸺ unpinned from the ground the bodies of a
woman and her child, who were fastened to the ground
by bayonets. Asked about what had passed at Boortmeerbeck,
Dr. V⸺ of Malines deposed: “Mme.
Van Rollegem came to the hospital of Malines on the
22nd August. On Thursday the 20th, as she was
fleeing from Boortmeerbeck with her husband, she
was shot twice in the leg. She threw herself into the
ditch to take shelter. Some minutes later the Germans
who had fired on her came up to her again and made
horrible wounds in her left thigh and left forearm.
She remained like that without help until Saturday
evening. The wounds were gangrened and worms
were swarming over them.”</p>

<p>During the night of the 23rd to 24th August soldiers
knocked violently at the door of the Château of Canne,
owned by M. Poswick. Mme. Poswick opened the
door; she was forthwith bludgeoned with the butt-ends
of rifles. On Sunday, the 30th of August, a patrol
of hussars, as a Lord’s day recreation, amused themselves
by firing, on the Brussels road at Malines, at
Catherine Van Kerchove, a woman of seventy-four
years of age, at every part of her they could hit without
killing her. A rifle shot carried off her right hand,
another gashed her cheek. At Battice, before burning
houses, the Germans made women go into them and
shut them up there.</p>

<p>Sometimes German barbarism spent itself in putting
people in captivity. At Dinant many women were
kept shut up in the Abbaye des Prémontrés. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
they remained seated on the floor without food. Four
of them were confined under these dreadful conditions
(see <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chap. XIII</a>).</p>

<h3>Poland and Serbia</h3>

<p>Such acts were outdone at the other end of Europe,
in the Eastern theatre of war. In Poland, at Khabbeck,
the Austrians mutilated two women on the
pretext that civilians were helping the movements of
the Russian troops.</p>

<p>In the Podogorsky Arrondissement the Serbian
troops found in the village of Jabonka the corpses of
a young girl of about ten years old and of three old
women, all three alike mutilated. Finally, Professor
Reiss, of the University of Lausanne, who visited the
Serbian territories invaded by the Austro-Hungarians,
confirmed the authenticity of the mutilations in which
the invader of Serbia had indulged.</p>

<p>“At Bastave” (he reports in his letter to the <i>Temps</i>
of 22nd November) “nearly everybody took to flight
when it was known that the Austrians were approaching.
The two infirm women named Soldatovich, aged
seventy-two and seventy-eight years, did not want to
leave their house. They thought that even the most
cruel men would do nothing to invalided old women.
But when the peasants came back after the Austrians
had gone, they found that the two poor old women
had been violated, stabbed with bayonet thrusts, their
noses, ears and breasts cut. Besides, mutilation was
quite a usual practice amongst the murderers of the
Austro-Hungarian army.”</p>

<p>These barbarous acts, when they did not cause the
victim’s death, sometimes brought on insanity. This
was the case, amongst other instances, with several
women of Louvain, who were escorted by a detachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of the 162nd German infantry regiment to the
riding-school of the town, and having, from want of
room, passed a whole night standing, endured such
terrible sufferings that they lost their reason.</p>

<h3>Abduction</h3>

<p>Let us take the case of abduction of women, led
away by German soldiers and brought in troops to
Germany. These wretched women were put down
as hostages. It is, however, certain that in more than
one case they were led away merely to gratify the
soldiers’ lust.</p>

<p>At Marcheville the Germans carried off several
hundreds of women, who were interned at Amberg in
Bavaria in barracks. At Saint-Mihiel seven or eight
hundred women were also carried off to Germany.</p>

<p>At Charleville the women were kept on the spot, but
brought to their several tasks and kept under a regimen
of forced labour. They were kept constantly employed
in making equipments for the troops, earning a wage
of half-a-loaf of bread. At Bignicourt-sur-Saulx forty
women were carried off, as hostages it was said. The
Hungarian dragoons in particular, in Poland and in the
Lublin and Kielce regions, were noted for this kind of
conduct, revived from the most barbarous periods
of war.</p>

<p>The second report of the French Commission of
Inquiry (<i>Journal Officiel</i> of 11th March, 1915) gives
striking details of the fate of Frenchwomen who were
carried away from their own country and interned
in Germany.</p>

<p>For the most part separated from their children,
there was no kind of violence to which they had not
to submit. The lack of food induced among them
frightful maladies, which they had to endure under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the most horrible conditions. So acute were their
sufferings, that afterwards, when they were released,
they were very depressed, under the idea that they
were still in prison, and were obsessed with morbid
fears. Several of them, including some octogenarians,
had to be carried on stretchers.</p>

<h3>Violation</h3>

<p>The number of women outraged by Germans where
they lived is considerable. Violation was practised
everywhere on invaded territory as a right of war,
and without distinction of age. We feel in touch with
an odious perversity as we read the story of these
outrages, in which a depraved imagination is as
prominent as their brutality.</p>

<p>On the 4th September, at Rebais, a young woman
of twenty-nine years, a wine-seller, was accused of
having concealed English soldiers at her house. The
Germans undressed her, and compelled her to stay in
that condition in their midst for an hour and a half.
Then they fastened her to her counter, and threatened
her with death. The wretched woman would infallibly
have died had not orders, which suddenly arrived,
compelled her torturers to be off and leave her in the
hands of an Alsatian soldier, who released her.</p>

<p>The French Commission of Inquiry reports two cases
of violation committed in each of the places it was able
to visit, especially at Villers, Trumilly, Sermaize, etc.
Special indignation is aroused by those of which quite
young girls were the victims.</p>

<p>At Château-Thierry it was a girl of only fourteen
years of age, who was dragged into a shop by three
Germans, where, under threat of a bayonet, she was
violated by two of them, while the third gave way to
the young victim’s entreaties. At Begu-Saint-Germain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
it was a girl of thirteen years. At Loupy-le-Château
it was on children of thirteen and eight years that such
outrages were committed. At Magnières a little child
of twelve years was violated twice by a soldier. At
Suippy, on the 3rd September, a child of eleven years
was for three hours the butt of the brutality of a man,
who found her with her sick grandmother, brought
her into a deserted house, and stuffed a handkerchief
into her mouth to prevent her crying.</p>

<p>Unbridled bestiality of this kind had no more
respect for age than childhood. The nature of some
of these acts seems to prove the existence in the German
race not merely of moral, but of physical defects.
With amazement and disgust we put on record the
evidence for acts which in ordinary life are found only
in the diseased or maniacs.</p>

<p>At Vitry-en-Perthois a German violated an old
woman of eighty-nine years, who died as a result. At
Loupy-le-Château an unfortunate woman of seventy-five
years was violated; at Suippes another old woman,
aged seventy-two years, was seized by a German
soldier, who was putting the muzzle of his revolver
under her chin, when the woman’s brother-in-law came
along and released her. In Serbia the corpses of
mutilated old women, the discovery of which we noted
above, were examined, and it was proved that these
old women had been violated before being mutilated.
In certain places soldiers were seen outraging dead
bodies. This fact was established at Gerbeviller, the
culprit being a Bavarian of the army corps commanded
by General Clauss.</p>

<h3>Hateful Consequences of these Acts</h3>

<p>Several victims of these crimes died: others lost
their reason. For a large number the natural consequences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of these acts condemn them to become
mothers.</p>

<p>Of all the victims of invasion, none have been more
unfortunate than these. The practice of abortion
cannot be tolerated. They are condemned to bring
into the world the hateful fruit of savage bestiality.
It should at least be admitted that they should be
absolved from the duty of feeding and loving this
offspring. A law to this effect will doubtless be passed
in France. Permission will be given to declare that
the children are the issue of unknown parents. The
Committee for Public Assistance will assume responsibility
and thus spare private families the morally
intolerable burden of bringing up the children of
Germans.</p>

<h3>Resistance punished with Death</h3>

<p>A number of women who resisted the violence of
the soldiers were killed either by rifle shots or bayonet
thrusts. At Esternay, on the night of Sunday, 6th
September, the soldiers violated widow Bouché, her
two daughters, and two women called Lhomme and
Macé. When the mother resisted they fired on the
whole group. Mme. Lhomme was struck, and Marcelle
Bouché, who was seriously wounded, succumbed the
following morning as a result of her wound. At
Rebais, a lady of thirty-four years, who resisted the
soldiers, was seized and strung up, but she was able
to cut the rope with a knife which she found in her
pocket. Then they beat her unmercifully, until an
officer came up and released her.</p>

<p>In Belgium, at Aerschot, a young Belgian woman
had to pay with her life for the intervention of her
fiancé, whom the soldiers also massacred. More deplorable
still is the case of a young girl of Louvain, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
body was pierced all over with bayonet thrusts, and
who was then violated. Next day she was brought
to hospital, but she succumbed to the wounds inflicted
upon her.</p>

<h3>Refinement of Depravity</h3>

<p>In order to increase the horror of these scenes, the
Germans were pleased to commit their crimes even in
the presence of the parents of these wretched girls.
It was not enough for them to shame their victim,
they must do it under the eyes of those whose duty
it was to defend her, and whom they first made
powerless. Pierre Nothomb’s book contains numerous
examples. We tremble with indignation as we
read the story.</p>

<p>In France, at Coulommiers, a woman was violated
on the 6th September before her husband and children.
At Saint Denis-les-Rebais another was violated in the
presence of her mother-in-law, who, being powerless
to intervene, tried to prevent her little grandson, aged
eight, from seeing this disgraceful sight. At Commigis
(Aisne) a lady was made the object of violent and
shameless acts by two Germans, also in her mother-in-law’s
presence. At Raucourt (Meurthe-et-Moselle)
the Germans violated a woman in the presence of her
children.</p>

<h3>German Admissions</h3>

<p>On the question of the murder of women, young and
old, M. Bédier’s book contains the admissions of the
Germans themselves. Those of Blamont are told by
the German soldier, Paul Spielmann (of the First
Guards Infantry Brigade). “It was horrible: blood
was plastered over all the houses, and as for the faces
of the dead, they were hideous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Among them were many old women and one pregnant
woman.” The excuse alleged was “there was
telephonic communication with the enemy.” The
existence of this telephone was the cause of this fearful
massacre.</p>

<p>The outrages at Langeviller and another locality
are put on record in an unsigned notebook of a soldier
of the 11th Battalion of Pioneers. “Langeviller,
22nd August, a village demolished by the 11th Battalion
of Pioneers. <i>Three women hanged on trees</i>: the
first dead whom I had seen.” Why were these women
hanged? We are not told. Eight days afterwards, he
continues, “We destroyed eight houses. In a single
one of them two men and their wives and a young
girl of eighteen had been bayoneted. I was almost
moved at the sight of the little one, <i>her look was so
full of innocence</i>. But an excited body of men could
no longer be kept in check, for at such moments we
are no longer men, but beasts.” Here, we see, full
confession is made. Another notes that at Orchies
“a woman had a military execution.” Why? For
not having obeyed the command to “halt.”</p>

<p>Something even of the acts of violence runs through
these confessions. A soldier of the 12th infantry reserve,
3rd corps, writes, “I am forced to note one fact which
cannot be due to accident, but there are, even in our
army, some … who are no longer men, some …
to whom nothing is sacred. Last night a man of the
Landwehr, more than thirty-five years old, wanted
to violate the daughter of the house on which he
quartered himself, a mere little girl, and when her
father intervened he pointed his bayonet against the
man’s chest.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">OFFENCES AGAINST CHILDREN, OLD PEOPLE AND
PRIESTS</span></h2>

<p>The plea of reprisals is no more valid in the case of
children, old people and priests than it is in the case
of women. All these classes of people have a right to
consideration and to absolute respect from the invader.
Every crime committed against them can bear no other
name than wanton cruelty.</p>

<p>In the foregoing pages we have seen how children
were killed with their mothers, and old women were
outraged and killed. We must now unfold the chapter
of crimes against the weak and against those whose
character should have saved them from the violences
of war. Ill-treatment, imprisonment, wounds, murder,
torture—all these we hardly like to think that children,
the personification of weakness and innocence, have
had to suffer. Such has been the cruelty of the German
troops in the field, that what has moved all
men’s interest and compassion has, in several cases,
only urged them on the more readily to violence.</p>

<h3>Belgian and French Children ill-treated,
wounded and killed</h3>

<p>We have already told the story of the ill-treatment
to which six to eight thousand people, who were packed
together standing in the riding-school and had to pass
the night there, were exposed at Louvain. A number
of children were included in these. Several endured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
great hardships, and the youngest died in their mothers’
arms. At Dinant, in the slaughter which took place,
several children were massacred.</p>

<p>In other cases we see that children were exposed to
exceptional acts of violence. “On the way back from
Tirlemont,” writes the special correspondent of the
<i>Times</i> (29th August, 1914), “I met a little girl of eleven
years old, who was stumbling and groping before her
as if blind. A stroke of a lance had laid open her
cheek and her eye. A poor peasant woman, her face
wet with tears, told me that her husband had been
killed in her presence by German horsemen, that two
of her children, who were under nine years of age, had
been trampled by their horses and that two others
were missing. And this” (concluded the English
journalist) “is not an isolated case; it is an example
of what happens day by day in the areas occupied by
the German soldiers, and, I regret to say, it is only an
example among hundreds which have been attested
beyond any possibility of doubt.”</p>

<p>Instances abound, and the following are a selection.
At Louguyon, out of 153 people who were shot on the
23rd, 24th and 25th August by soldiers of the 102nd
and 112th Prussian regiments, there were twelve
children.</p>

<p>At Bantheville (Meuse), young Felix Miquel, aged
about fifteen years, who had hidden behind a heap
of wood so that he might not be arrested, got a violent
sabre thrust from the soldier who discovered him,
which split his lips; afterwards, as he was being led
away, when he tried to hide in a wood, he stumbled
against a sentinel, who with a bayonet stroke cut off
a joint of his left hand.</p>

<p>At Mouchy Humières (Oise) a little four-year-old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
girl, who belonged to a family living in Verdun, was
wounded on the 31st August by a German soldier.
On the way from Bouligny to Mourière (Meuse) a
child of fifteen years was shot in the groin as she
was passing quietly by a wood in which a German
patrol was concealed.</p>

<p>At Spontin, near Dinant, fearful reprisals were
carried out because a poacher had killed a Prussian
officer, and children of all ages were shot or butchered
with their mothers.</p>

<p>In the outskirts of Malines many corpses of children
were found on the spot where the Germans had left
them unburied. At Morfontaine, near Longwy, two
children of fifteen were shot for having warned the
French gendarmes of the arrival of the enemy. At
Gerbeviller a young girl named Parmentier, who was
barely seven years old, was also shot. At Dinant,
too, several children met with the same fate. At
Aerschot the burgomaster’s two children were shot;
the murder of the little girls Luychx and Ooyen, aged
twelve and nine years, both of whom were shot,
was also confirmed. Pierre Nothomb quotes the case
of two little children two years old, named Neef and
Deekers, who were massacred at Testelt. Sometimes
the despicable torturers added obscenity to cruelty.
At Bertrex a grown-up brother and sister were killed
and, when the penalty was paid, their bodies were
put naked, clasping each other as if they had been
embracing.</p>

<h3>Children tortured by Germans</h3>

<p>At Hofstade, said Pierre Nothomb, a lad of less
than fifteen years was found with hands crossed behind
his back and his body pierced with bayonet thrusts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
At Pin, near Izel, two young boys saw the Uhlans
coming; the latter took them as they passed, and
made them run, with hands bound, between their
galloping horses. Their dead bodies were found an
hour afterwards in a ditch; as an eye-witness said,
their knees were “literally worn out”; one had his
throat cut and his breast laid open; each had a bullet
in his head. At Schaffen a lad was bound to a shutter,
sprinkled with petrol, and burnt alive. The soldiers
who marched on Antwerp took a butcher’s cleaver
at Sempst; they seized a little servant boy, cut off
his legs, then his head, and roasted him in a burning
house. At Lebbeke-les-Termonde, Frans Mertens and
his comrades, Van Dooren, Dekinder, Stobbelaer and
Wryer, were bound arm to arm; their eyes were
gouged out with a pointed weapon, then they were
killed by rifle shots.</p>

<p>In France, at Dompierre-aux-Bois, the children who
were wounded in the bombardment of the church
found themselves left to their agony, without attendance
and without food. The dead bodies of two
children who had been killed by bayonet thrusts
were found at Neuville-en-Artois. At Vingras a little
girl of eight years was thrust into the flames with her
parents, whose farmhouse had been set on fire. At
Sommeilles the dead body of a child of eleven was
found with its foot cut off. At Triaucourt the wretches
burnt a two-year-old child.</p>

<p>In Serbia similar outrages were committed. M.
Reiss, Professor of Lausanne University, has proved
that children of two months old were massacred.
“I found children in common ditches who were not
more than two or three years old. Amongst the 109
hostages of Lechnitza who were shot in front of a ditch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
which had previously been dug out, and which was
not less than twenty metres long, there were some
children of not more than eight years old.”</p>

<h3>German Admissions</h3>

<p>We read above the admission of a soldier of the
Prussian Guard, Paul Spielmann, about the massacre
of a village which “had been in telephonic communication
with the enemy.” Among those who
were massacred he adds that there were three children.
“I saw this morning (2nd September) four little boys
carrying on two sticks a cradle in which was a child
of five to six months old. All that is fearful to behold.
Blow for blow. Cannon for cannon. Everything was
given up to pillage.</p>

<p>“… <i>I saw also a mother with her two little ones;
one had a great wound on the head and the other had its
eye gouged out.</i>”</p>

<p>The German soldier, Karl Johann Kaltendshner,
Ninth Company of the Regiment of Count Bülow
Tervuenwist, who deserted and fled to Holland, and
whose statements in the <i>Telegraaf</i> we have already
quoted, tells the following story: “I have seen
children in tears, clinging to their defenceless mothers’
skirts, coming out of a threshing-mill where they had
sought shelter, and <i>I have seen how these mothers and
their children were killed in cowardly and cold-blooded
fashion</i>. Although we were compelled, under penalty
of death, to obey all the orders of our officers, <i>I have
seen some of my companions who joyfully performed
their melancholy work of massacre. At a certain
moment I was myself required to shoot two boys, aged
fifteen and twelve years old respectively</i>, whose father
had already been killed. I had not the heart to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
it, and I had lowered my arm, expecting to be executed
myself, when one of my comrades, jeering at my
sentimentality, saved me by pushing me aside and
himself firing on the two children. <i>The eldest fell
stark dead, and the second, who got a bullet in the back,
was dispatched with a revolver shot</i>” (<i>Temps</i>, 3rd
January, 1915).</p>

<h3>Outrages on Old People</h3>

<p>At every place where the civil population was
brutally treated, outraged or shot <i>en masse</i>—at Louvain,
at Dinant—no exception was made in the case of old
folk. People of seventy and eighty years of age had
to bear forced marches, to remain standing in packed
masses, where they were kept for whole nights, at the
risk of death, as was the result for a large number.
But, in addition to these common instances, outrages
of a peculiar kind are not wanting. At Rebais-en-Brie
an old man of sixty-nine years old, Auguste Griffaut,
was struck with blows of the fist on the head, and
finally wounded by a revolver shot. At Sablonnières
another old man of the same name, Jules Griffaut,
aged sixty-six, was tending his cows in an enclosed
field when a German soldier, who was at the rear of
a column, fired on him. In Belgium an old man of
seventy years, formerly steward to M. Davignon,
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Belgium,
was shot by the Germans because to the first question
that the latter put to him he replied that he was
deaf, which was true.</p>

<p>Another was shot without mercy at Montmirail
because he tried to protect a widow, named Naudé,
who was in danger of being outraged by a non-commissioned
officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>At Lamath, in Lorraine, an old man called Louis,
aged seventy years, was shot. At Domèvre-sur-Vezouze
Adolphe Claude, aged seventy-five years,
met with the same fate. At Lunéville an old alderman,
Théophile Martin, aged sixty-three years, was
commanded by an officer to come out of his house
with his two daughters. As soon as they came out
the old man saw from the revolvers and guns that
were levelled at him that he was about to be killed.
The young girls threw themselves on their knees and
begged the Germans to spare their father’s life. It
was in vain. Shots rang out and the old man
fell. Again at Lunéville, M. Édouard Bernard,
municipal councillor, aged sixty-five years, who had
six sons at the front, was arrested. He was hardly
allowed time to dress himself. He was taken away,
and it is not known what became of him. M. Charles
Chérer, husbandman, aged sixty-four, first cousin to
M. Lébrun, ex-minister, got four bullets in his body.
As none of the wounds which they made was
mortal, the Uhlans dispatched him with revolver
shots.</p>

<p>At Nomény M. Petitjean, aged eighty-six years,
was struck as he was sitting in his armchair by a
bullet which cracked his skull, and a German took
pleasure in doing violence to the dead body (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page_148">p. 148</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, the number of old people who were taken
away as hostages or simply deported to Germany was
very large. Of that we shall speak in a subsequent
chapter, but let us only note here that among the
hostages who were taken away to Vareddes four old
men were shot or bludgeoned with the butt-ends of
rifles, their names being Jourdaine (73 years old),
Liévin (61), Ménil (65) and Milliardet (78 years).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<h3>Torture of Old People</h3>

<p>On the 26th August, not far from Malines, the dead
body of an old man was found bound by the arms to
a beam in the ceiling of his farmhouse. The body
was completely burnt, except the head, arms and feet.</p>

<p>At Triaucourt, in France, an old man of seventy,
Jean Lecouturier, was thrown into the flames of a
burning house.</p>

<p>At Champuis, Jacquemin was bound to his bed
by a non-commissioned officer, and left in this state
without food for three days. He died some days
afterwards. At Lavigneville (Meuse), on the 23rd
September, MM. Woimbée, aged sixty-one years, and
Fortin, aged sixty-five years, both farmers, were
arrested in their own homes on the plea that they
were francs-tireurs. Now, Woimbée had had his foot
shattered two months before, and Fortin, who was
afflicted with chronic rheumatism, had for long been
unable to walk without the help of a stick. The
Germans carried them off in their working garb,
without allowing them to take any other clothes,
and attached them to a convoy which contained
about thirty soldiers who had been taken prisoner.
Fortin, who could not get on, was bound by a rope,
the ends of which were held by two horsemen, and,
notwithstanding his infirmity, he had to keep up
with the horses. As he fell every minute, he was
struck with lances to compel him to get up again.
The wretched man, covered with blood, besought them
in mercy to kill him. At last Woimbée obtained permission
to carry him to the village of Saint-Maurice-sous-les-Côtés,
with the help of several of our soldiers.
There the Germans made the two old men go into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
house, compelled them to remain standing for two
hours face to the wall and arms crossed, whilst they
themselves rattled their arms noisily so as to make
their victims believe they were going to shoot them.
At last they decided to let them lie on the ground,
and gave them a little bread and water. For more
than twenty-four hours Woimbée and Fortin had had
no food.</p>

<p>In Poland, at Andrief, the Germans, displeased because
they had only got a little money from the alderman
of the town, closed up the latter, M. Krassinsky,
aged seventy years, in his house and set fire to it.</p>

<h3>Outrages on Priests</h3>

<p>The crimes committed in Belgium and France
against the priests deserve separate treatment.</p>

<p>The German newspapers and the Emperor alleged,
in justification of these acts, that at the beginning
of hostilities the curés and nuns of the invaded
regions had abused their spiritual authority over the
civil population by rousing them to frenzy and inciting
them to act as francs-tireurs. But of such
acts Germany has brought forward no proof. On
the contrary, the German Catholic bureau Pax and
the <i>Kölnische Volkszeitung</i> took the trouble personally
to refute a great number of accusations against
the clergy, amongst others the famous legend of eyes
being gouged out, of which we spoke above and with
which German newspapers had connected the names
of several priests who had been carried away to
Germany.</p>

<p>As for the general plea that they had encouraged
the civil population to resist, far from justifying the
German conduct, it only makes it more odious, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
what finer praise could be given to a priest in time
of war than to say that he tried to stimulate the love
of country among the faithful, especially when it is
traitorously attacked by people who violate their
pledged word?</p>

<p>Besides, the very accounts of the outrages in question
show that the plea of reprisals has no validity.
In these stories the immorality and blasphemy of the
torturers reveals itself without any disguise. The
worst criminal feels a kind of fear and remorse as he
stands in the presence of God’s representative. This
fear is unknown to the German soldier. The German
invaders have even shown that they are devoid of
respect for the sacred or charitable occupations in
the midst of which they almost everywhere found the
priests whom they have been known to massacre.
With them everything has given way to the deliberate
desire to sow terror among the civil population. In
many places it is certain that this end could not be
better attained than by ill-treating and massacring
their spiritual heads.</p>

<h3>Ill-Treatment</h3>

<p>M. Auguste Mélot, deputy of Namur, published a
book, <i>Martyre du Clergé Belge</i>, which throws light
upon this conduct so far as Belgium is concerned.</p>

<p>The curés of Wygmael and Wesemael were forced
to march, on the 29th August, before the army with
their elbows bound together. A curé of Rotselaer
and a curé of Wackerzeel, aged seventy years, were
shut up for whole days in a church, almost without
food and under dreadful conditions. They were
finally brought away to Germany, where insults were
heaped upon them. A German officer at Aix-la-Chapelle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
spat in the face of the curé of Rotselaer.
Tainted bread was given them to eat. At last they
were brought back to Belgium, by forced marches,
from Brussels to Haeren, from Haeren to Vilvorde,
from Vilvorde to Malines.</p>

<p>The Germans indulged in outrages of a disgraceful
kind on the curé of Beyghem. The curé and the
curate of Ellwyt were shut up for five days in their
church. The curé of Schaffen-lez-Diest was hanged.
They made him believe that he was going to be put
to death, and when he was on the point of dying they
loosed the rope; then they started again. Afterwards
they compelled him to look at the sun, and if
he lowered his eyes he was struck with the butt-ends
of rifles and threatened with being hung up again.
The curé of Yvoir was compelled to march in front of
the troops as far as Marienburg, laden with a sack.
At Pin the Germans made five priests walk for ten
leagues, allowing them for food nothing but a little
bread and water. The Superior of the French College
of Florennes (in Belgium) was beaten, struck with
butt-ends of rifles and with spurs on the back and
the head. He was then stripped of his robes and
left dying. The curate of Montigny-sur-Sambre was
struck with the fist, and obliged to walk under the
horsewhip, with hands bound, in front of the troops.
The Bishop of Tournai, who was seventy-two years
of age, was brought on foot, being beaten as he went,
from Tournai to Ach.</p>

<h3>Murder of Priests</h3>

<p>According to inquiries made in four dioceses out
of six, Malines, Liège, Namur and Tournai, it has
been possible to fix the names of forty-four priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
whom the Germans killed and of a dozen who are
missing. These names are found in M. Mélot’s book.</p>

<p>These crimes took place when a priest took it upon
him to resist some massacre or some other kind of
crime ordered by the Germans. Thus M. Wonters,
curé of Pont-Brûlé, was shot because he wanted to
prevent a German soldier from ill-treating an old
prisoner. Another was killed because he tried to
prevent an act of violation which was about to be
committed under his eyes. On other occasions the
crime took place without motive, or at least the
motive alleged was trivial. For example, the curé
of Blegny was shot for having, so it was said, allowed
an observation post to be placed in the belfry of his
church. However, it is certain that he could not
have prevented it.</p>

<h3>Torture of Priests</h3>

<p>Some priests died as a result of the agonies inflicted
upon them. The executioners were not content with
killing them outright; they wanted to make them
suffer as well.</p>

<p>M. de Clerck, the curé of Buecken, who was accused
of having fired on the Germans, was first placed on
a cannon. When his tormentors had their fill of
watching his terror, they threw him into a ditch.
Then the soldiers took him, some by the arm, others
by a leg, and dragged him over the pavement. Only
then did they shoot him. However, it was certain
that he had not fired on any one. He suffered from
diabetes, and was confined to his bed when the Germans
entered into the village, and they could not
have been unaware of the fact, for it was from his bed
that they went to take him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Dergent, curé of Gelrode, found he was accused
of spying for the English. Without any explanation
he was brought to the town hall, ill-treated, brought
in front of the church, struck with the butt-ends of
rifles, then shot.</p>

<p>M. Glouden, curé of La Tour, and two other priests
who, by permission of the German commandant,
were taking up the wounded on the Ethe territory
had a machine-gun turned upon them, and were then
dispatched with revolver shots, by order of the same
commandant.</p>

<p>The curé of Spontin was taken in his bed, dragged
half-naked out of his house, and hung up several
times, sometimes by the feet, sometimes by the hands.
Afterwards he was stabbed with bayonets and then shot.</p>

<p>There is no better picture of the hatred of the
Germans towards members of the Belgian clergy than
the proclamation about hostages which was posted
up on the 6th September at Grivegnée, especially
when we know the fate which was almost always
reserved for them. The proclamation said: “<i>In the
front rank were placed as hostages priests</i>, burgomasters
and other public officials.”</p>

<h3>The Arrest of Cardinal Mercier</h3>

<p>The abominable behaviour of the Germans to the
Belgian Catholic clergy was crowned by the arrest of
Cardinal Mercier, Archbishop of Malines. The following
is the account of the circumstances under which
he was arrested, given by the reverend prelate in a
letter of the 10th January, sent secretly to all the
parishes in the diocese of Malines.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You are, doubtless, aware of a communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
made by the German Government to the Brussels
daily papers, to the effect that the cardinal archbishop
of Malines had in no wise been hampered in
the exercise of his episcopal duties. The facts show
how far this communication is from the truth.</p>

<p>“On the evening of the 1st January and on the
following morning soldiers forced their way into the
apartments of the curés, seized my pastoral letter
and entered an injunction against it. They forbade
the curés to read it to their flocks, threatening, in
case of disobedience, the severest penalties to their
parishes and to themselves.</p>

<p>“On the 2nd January, at 6 a.m., I received the
order to appear during the morning before the
Government, to give explanations with regard to my
letter to the priests and their parishioners.</p>

<p>“On the following day I was forbidden to take
part in the religious service at the Cathedral of
Antwerp.</p>

<p>“Finally, I was not permitted to travel freely to
visit the other bishops of Belgium.</p>

<p>“Thus your rights and mine have been violated.</p>

<p>“As a Belgian citizen, as pastor, and as a member
of the Sacred College of Cardinals I protest energetically
against the violation of these rights.</p>

<p>“Whatever interpretation others may have put
upon my pastoral letter, experience has proved that
it caused no risk of rebellion. On the contrary, it
had the effect of calming and soothing people’s minds.
I congratulate you on having done your duty.”</p>

</div>

<p>Using Cardinal Mercier’s pastoral letter as a pretext,
the Germans proceeded to fresh acts of violence
against the Catholic clergy. We need not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
be astonished that this letter enunciated a certain
principle—to wit, that the Belgians owed allegiance
only to the King and to the Government of the nation
of which they form a part. The Cardinal went on
to instruct his people that none the less they should
accept the actual situation in the occupied districts,
and leave to the regular army the task of national
defence. These declarations, which are in absolute
harmony not only with the teachings of religion and
the principles of the law of nations, but also with the
laws of war, gave the Germans a pretext for ill-treating
several members of the clergy, desecrating a certain
number of churches, tearing the priests from their
confessionals, and looting sacristies.</p>

<h3>Outrages on the French Clergy</h3>

<p>The town of Roye was occupied by the Germans
on the 7th September. On the morning of the 9th
a burial was taking place. At the very time when
the service was being held in the church, a French
machine-gun came into the town and forthwith
began to fire at a German outpost which had taken
up a position in the town hall. The Germans rushed
madly into the church, to the number of about fifty,
and, to the great indignation of those who were
present, seized the two officiating priests and the two
choristers. Still clad in their sacred vestments, the
priests were led into the line of fire of the French
machine-guns, and it was only by a miracle that they
escaped the bullets. In the sequel, the machine-gun
could not keep up its fire and had to leave the town.</p>

<p>During this time the crowd had escaped from the
church by the sacristy and the adjoining gardens, and
the coffin remained alone without celebrants or congregation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
The Germans did not release their victims.
They compelled the two priests and the two choristers
to get into a motor, forcing them to remain standing,
and brought them like that to Chauny, where the
German general staff was installed. Their intention
was doubtless to intimidate the villages through
which this wretched party passed.</p>

<p>At Chauny the two priests and the two choristers
remained for more than twenty-four hours without
food or drink, and were kept prisoners for three days.
Their release was only brought about through the
intervention of the professor of German at the college
of Chauny, who by dint of parleying and negotiation
had them set at liberty; they returned to Roye,
where they were believed to be dead.</p>

<p>In the diocese of Cambrai six priests were first of
all killed by the Germans. The assassination of the
Abbé Delebecque, of Valenciennes, which followed,
must be described in detail.</p>

<p>On the 16th September this priest was coming back
from a service which had taken place at Dunkirk for
the repose of the soul of his father, who had died in
the month of August. He was riding a bicycle and
was carrying some letters written by soldiers. He
was stopped by a patrol and accused of espionage.
He was sentenced the same day at midnight. In
spite of his denials and of the obvious proofs which
he gave of his good faith, the council of war, consisting
of officers, condemned him to death. Handed
over to the charge of the German military chaplain,
he passed the night in prayer before the Holy Sacrament
in St. Nicholas Church. Then, having given confession
and received the sacrament, he set out bravely at 5.30
on foot to the Dampierre Column, on the way to
Denain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>As he went he was repeating the prayer for the
dying. When he reached the spot fixed by the
Germans he sent a letter to his mother, then knelt
down and said to some people present that he gave
his life for France. At six o’clock the Abbé Delebecque
fell, hit by twelve German bullets.</p>

<p>A hole fifty centimetres deep was made and he was
thrown into it. As the end of his cassock protruded,
a civilian came and placed some stones upon it in the
form of a cross, and some women threw flowers on
the tomb of this martyr. Finally, the Superior of
Notre Dame College, who had the German military
chaplain lodging with him, with some difficulty got
his consent to the body being given back to him, that
suitable burial might be given to it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Curé Fossin, of Vareddes,
was shot on the charge of having signalled to a French
troop from the top of his belfry.</p>

<p>In the department of Meurthe-et-Moselle two curés
were also shot, M. Thiriet at Deuxville and M. Barbot
at Rehainviller.</p>

<p>But the most horrible outrage inflicted upon people
dedicated to God was that suffered by two nuns in a
commune of the department of Meurthe-et-Moselle.
They were handed over defenceless to a soldier’s
lechery. “The pledges which we have given,” writes
the French Commission of Inquiry, which denounces
this crime in its report, “prevent our making known
the names of the victims of this disgusting exhibition,
or of the village in which it took place, but the facts
have been revealed to us under oath and in confidence
by most trustworthy witnesses, and we take the
responsibility of attesting their authenticity.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">OUTRAGES ON CIVILIANS AND FRANCS-TIREURS</span></h2>

<h3>The German Theory of Francs-tireurs</h3>

<p>The behaviour of the Germans to civilians gives
us the opportunity of considering, before we proceed
further, a theory which they promulgated at the
outbreak of war, and which referred to the distinction
that would be made as regards non-combatants who
took up arms against invasion.</p>

<p>In the early days of the war the German Government,
through the agency of a neutral power, communicated
the following two documents to France
and Belgium. In order to show that the principle is
both technically wrong and inhuman, we propose to
reproduce them in full. The first of these documents
is as follows—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT</p>

<p>“<i>The reports of German troops show that in
contempt of the law of nations, a national war has
been organised in France. In many cases the
inhabitants of the country, under the protection
of civilian garb, fired surreptitiously on German
soldiers. Germany is opposed to this method of
making war, which is a violation of the law of
nations. The German troops have been instructed
to stamp out this kind of resistance by the most
rigorous measures. Every non-combatant inhabitant
who carries arms, impedes communications,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
cuts telegraph wires, uses explosive appliances—in
short, any one who takes any illegitimate part
in the war, will at once be brought before our courts-martial
and shot. If by this means the war becomes
violent Germany declines all responsibility
for it, and France alone will be responsible for the
floods of blood that will be shed.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The second document is in the following terms—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“TO THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT</p>

<p>“<i>His Majesty’s Government of Belgium have
rejected Germany’s sincere offer to spare them the
horrors of war. Belgium has willed war and has
replied to our proposal by armed opposition.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Notwithstanding the note of the 8th August, by
which the Belgian Government intimated that, in
accordance with the laws of war, they would wage
it only with soldiers, many civilians took part in
the battles at Liège, under the protection of civilian
garb. They not merely fired on the German troops,
but they cruelly killed the wounded and the doctors
who were doing their duty.</i></p>

<p>“<i>At Antwerp also civilians barbarously looted
the property of Germans, and brutally massacred
women and children. Germany asks the whole
civilised world to take note of the blood of these
unoffending people and of the Belgian method
of waging war which shows the low grade of their
civilisation. If henceforth the war becomes cruel
the fault lies with Belgium. In order to protect
the German troops against the unbridled passions
of the people, it is decreed that henceforth every
man who takes part in the conflict without being in
uniform and wearing the recognised distinguishing
marks, who impedes the communications of our
troops, cuts telegraph wires, uses explosive appliances—in
short, who takes any illegitimate part
whatsoever in the war, will be treated as a franc-tireur,
brought before a court-martial, and shot.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<h3>The German Military Authorities and
Non-combatants</h3>

<p>German generals and officers have quibbled about
inhumanity in their proclamations. The Burgomaster
of Hasselt could communicate to his fellow
townsmen on the 17th August the decision of the
German military authorities, by which, “<i>in case
civilians fired on the soldiers of the German army, a
third of the male population would be shot</i>.” The
German Generalissimo Bülow announced, in a proclamation
addressed to the communal authorities of
Liège (22nd August), that “the inhabitants of the
town of Andenne, after a declaration of their peaceful
intentions, treacherously made a surprise attack, and
that on this ground, <i>with his consent, the general in
command caused everything in the whole of the district
to be burnt, and that a hundred persons were shot</i>.” He
adds that the people of Liège “<i>ought to try to imagine
the fate with which they are threatened, if they adopt a
similar attitude</i>.” The commandant at Namur, who
had taken many hostages, declared that “<i>the life of
these hostages is at stake unless the civilians remain
quiet under all circumstances</i>.” He demanded that “all
civilians walking about in his district” should show
their respect to German officers by taking off their
hats, or by raising their hands to their head as in a
military salute. In case of doubt, he adds, every
German soldier must be saluted. <i>Whoever declines to
do so must expect German soldiers to make themselves
respected by every means.</i></p>

<h3>Francs-tireurs</h3>

<p>These proclamations are a denial, pure and simple,
of the right of civilians to resist an invader. This
right, however, is recognised by the Hague Convention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, these conventions declare that irregular
corps raised to meet an invader are permissible, and
that the soldiers who compose them must be treated
according to the laws of war, provided that they take
care—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) “to have at the head of them a person
who is responsible for his subordinates;</p>

<p>(2) “to have a distinguishing mark, which is
fixed and recognisable at a distance;</p>

<p>(3) “to carry arms openly;</p>

<p>(4) “and to conform in their operations to the
laws and customs of war.”</p>

</div>

<p>In conclusion the conventions go further, and add—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The civilians of an unoccupied territory
which on the approach of the enemy spontaneously
take up arms to combat the invading troops
without having had time to organise themselves
in conformity with the terms of Article I will be
considered as belligerent if they respect the laws
and customs of war.”</p>

</div>

<p>To this rule of international law Germany had subscribed,
both in 1899 and 1907, without any reservation.</p>

<p>Germany, therefore, is acting in violation of conventions
which she herself has signed, by treating as
rebels the inhabitants of invaded territories who
attack her before she has actually occupied the area
in which these inhabitants live; she lies when she
declares that this method of making war is “contrary
to the law of nations,” and she acts like a barbarous
tyrant when she announces that every civilian who
takes part in the war “will be brought before a court-martial
and shot.”</p>

<p>It is superfluous to observe how much more insolent
still are the notices issued by the German military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
authorities, in which the latter ignore not merely the
civil population’s right of armed resistance, but also the
declaration of the German Government, which affirmed
that only the non-combatant who participated in the
war would be brought before a court-martial and shot.</p>

<p>The right (which, by the way, is in this case non-existent)
of inflicting reprisals on individuals, the
right to which the German Government has appealed,
has been shamefully transformed by the German
military authorities into a right which consists of
ill-treating the whole population of a locality in case
a civilian may have fired on a German soldier, and
of offering this as a justification for the ruin of the
locality and the execution of the hostages.</p>

<p>As for the threat uttered by the German commandant,
which declared that whoever did not show
respect to German officers and did not give them the
military salute must expect that German soldiers
“would <i>use every means</i> to make themselves respected,”
we think it shows the lengths to which German frenzy
can go. In itself we may say that it tells us more
than all the acts of cruelty. These demands for
servile obeisance, uttered under threat of violence
and death, have in all times and in all history been
the mark of the basest tyrants. Such is the reign of
terror which Germany proposed to inflict upon
invaded territories by covering it up in fictitious
principles which were at variance with all recognised
conventions, and which were the expression of nothing
but her own caprice.</p>

<h3>The Attitude of the Belgian Government</h3>

<p>The declaration made by the Belgian Government
the 5th August, 1914, and referred to in the
communication of the German Government, reproduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
above, included the assurance that Belgium
would conform during the war to the laws and usages
of war laid down by the Hague Conferences. Belgium,
therefore, was perfectly within her rights in allowing
armed resistance by civilians, <i>in cases and under conditions
recognised as legitimate by the Hague Conventions</i>.
And it was only from caution and from
premonition of the fate which civilians would undergo,
if they failed in any one of the conditions defined in
the first article of the Hague Convention, that the
Belgian Government recommended civilians to refrain
from resistance. But a recommendation which was
made only as a precaution against flagrant injustice
does not rid an action, foreseen and in fact committed,
of its unjust character. In spite of the advice given
by their Government, the Belgians consequently did not
lose their right “to take up arms spontaneously on
the approach of the enemy to oppose invading troops,”
and, notwithstanding that opposition, of being treated
as belligerents by the Germans.</p>

<p>Did the Belgians exercise this right? In certain
places it is reported that some people did exercise it.
If the fact is as stated, we can see nothing in it but
what is worthy of admiration. Such instances do
infinite honour to Belgian patriotism. However, it
appears clear that the order given was followed, and
that the whole thing, if it took place at all, reduces
itself to the acts of individuals. The acts of violence
committed by the Germans have been no less far-reaching
and extreme, so true is it that, though invoking
principles which were notoriously erroneous
and cruel, the application which they made of them
was nevertheless lying and arbitrary. Such is the
first category of crimes committed by the Germans
against non-combatants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, even if they had had in this respect
some complaint to make of civilians, if they had been
authorised by the law of war to punish acts of violence
committed against them under conditions that were
forbidden, the right of repression which they invoke
could never go so far as the penalty of death. Every
addition thereto in point of punishment is excess, and
an indication of barbarism. To extend to a whole
population reprisals inflicted in consequence of a
single act is something no less abominable, but that
is just what the Germans have done.</p>

<h3>Crimes committed by the Germans in the
Exercise of Reprisals</h3>

<p>At Liège, on the 21st August, a shot was fired from
a house situated on the Quai des Pêcheurs. Immediately
the Germans opened fire with a machine-gun
and blew up on the spot twenty houses, whose inhabitants
were killed. Shortly afterwards ten other
houses on the Place de l’Université were set on fire,
but as the flames seemed to be spreading too much,
the firemen were ordered to put them out.</p>

<p>At Champguyon, on the 6th September, a man
named Louvet was arrested for having fired under
conditions forbidden by the laws of war. He was
liable to the penalty of death. Accordingly, ten
German soldiers fell on the wretched man, beat him
unmercifully with sticks in the presence of his wife,
dragged him away covered with blood, broke his
wrist, shattered his skull, and dragged him to the end
of the village, where at length they gave him the
finishing stroke.</p>

<p>The same rule would apply to the cases of André
Willen (twenty-three years of age), Gustave Lodts
(forty) and Jean Marken (forty), all inhabitants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Aerschot, in Belgium, if they had been guilty. The
Germans, instead of shooting them, bound them to
a tree and beat them, before burning the first alive
and burying the other two alive.</p>

<p>In the province of Namur a young man whom some
Uhlans had arrested was bound to two horses, who
dragged him along, then tied to a tree, and finally
shot. Under the same conditions M. Cognon, of Visé,
was thrown into the water with his abdomen torn open.
Holding in his entrails with one hand, he clung with
the other to a boat, until he grew weak and died.</p>

<p>The innumerable mutilations inflicted on Serbian
peasants at Chabatz and elsewhere show on this side
of the area of war the same barbarism in the carrying
out of reprisals. Some who were hardly wounded
were buried alive, for they had been shot in the lump,
and every one who fell was thrown into the common
ditch which had been dug out beforehand.</p>

<h3>Massacres of Civilians for Paltry Reasons</h3>

<p>No less criminal are the attacks made by the Germans
on the lives of civilians, for paltry reasons, for
slight insubordination to unimportant orders, or even
for acts that were quite blameless. The following are
some examples of these crimes.</p>

<p>In the government of Warsaw the Germans killed
a Polish magnate, Count Thomas Potocki, for merely
protesting against a requisition.</p>

<p>At Dartainitza, near Semlin, on the frontier of
Austria and Serbia, the whole of the inhabitants were
led by the Austrians to Petenwarden, where a quarter
of them were shot. The accusation alleged against
these peasants was that they had given expression
to their joy when the Serbians had entered Semlin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
It was the same with the villages of Bejania,
Sourtchine, Beclika and Pancsova.</p>

<p>At Vingias, in the department of the Aisne, the
owner of a farm was thrown into the flames because
he had harboured the French headquarters staff on
his farm.</p>

<p>At Mauperthuis four Germans who had previously
come in the morning to the house of a man named
Roger presented themselves again the afternoon.
“There were three of you this morning; there are
now but two! Get out!” said one of them. Immediately
Roger and an immigrant named Denet, to
whom he had been giving hospitality, were seized,
carried off and shot.</p>

<p>A young druggist who lived in a village near Étain
was shot for having gone to Étain with the sub-prefect
of Briey, who had carried letters there for his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>As for non-combatants who were found carrying
arms, they were consistently massacred.</p>

<h3>Massacre of Civilians without any Pretext</h3>

<p>Other executions took place without any pretext.
Sometimes the Germans gathered together, without
rhyme or reason, all the male inhabitants of a village,
and chose at haphazard a certain number, whom they
shot without any form of trial and simply with the
object of terrorising the population. Sometimes their
fury was directed against peasants who were already
struck with terror, and then whoever showed any
signs of wanting to avoid meeting the enemy was
shot for the mere reason that he had tried to flee
before the invader. Sometimes they took vengeance
on the inhabitants of a village where one of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
number had been killed by some enemy soldier in
retreat.</p>

<p>Sometimes they forced their way into houses, bent
on pillage, and as they thought the presence of the
inhabitants seemed inconvenient, they made haste to
assassinate them. Sometimes the fusillade was merely
an amusement or recreation for the Germans. This
took place sometimes during their marches from village
to village. The peasant who had the misfortune to
find himself in their path at once had a taste of their
cruelty. Sometimes the execution of peaceable, quiet
people served the Germans as a consolation for checks
which the enemy had inflicted upon them. Sometimes,
in their desire to offer some excuse for massacre,
they have been seen to make a show of evacuating a
village which it was said had been threatened, and
then to fire some shots, which they then blamed the
inhabitants for doing. Reprisals thereupon followed.
Sometimes they attacked peaceable peasants because
the latter opposed some offence which they wanted
to commit. The following are some accounts of acts
of this kind. They took place at Dinant, at Louvain,
at Nomény, at Lunéville, where, perhaps to a greater
extent than elsewhere, the fury of the invader was let
loose upon inoffensive persons.</p>

<h3>At Dinant</h3>

<p>A Dutchman, M. Staller, has told as follows in the
<i>Telegraaf</i> (quoted above, see <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chap. XI</a>) the story of
the massacre of the people of Dinant.</p>

<p>“On Friday, the 21st August, about a dozen Germans
ventured as far as the middle of the town in an
armoured motor, a regular moving fortress. They had
machine-guns with them, and whilst the motor rolled
along they fired to right and left at the houses, aiming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
chiefly, I maintain, at the upper storeys. It was already
late, and, as the majority of the people had retired,
many of them were killed or wounded in their beds.</p>

<p>“What happened on that night? Were there some
civilians who replied to this cowardly and unexpected
attack by revolver shots? I do not think so, for some
days before, by order of the burgomaster, they had all
given up their arms. Were the Germans drunk—as
their comrades told me later—and had they a quarrel
amongst themselves? What is certain is that the
next morning three soldiers were found dead on the
streets. I saw them. The Germans laid hold of this
fact as an excuse for bombarding the town.</p>

<p>“On Monday morning the Germans entered the
town. Their first act was to arrest 153 civilians, to
lead them on the Petite Place and shoot them. In
these terrible days, at Dinant as well as in the surrounding
villages like Anseremme, Leffe and Neffe,
more than 800 persons were killed, amongst whom
there were many women and children; and all this
for three German soldiers? No; but the Germans
alleged that after the bombardment, at the moment
of their attack on the town, the inhabitants had fired
from their houses. What had happened? I know
very well, and the Germans could not fail to know it.
The Grand Rue of Dinant, parallel with the Meuse,
is joined to the river by a number of lanes; the
French, who were posted on the other bank, killed
through these lanes a large number of Germans, and
the enemy pretended that the citizens had fired on
them. They started then by shooting 153 people,
after which 500 were arrested and brought to Cassel.
As for us, we were brought to the Abbaye des
Prémontrés; for three days women and children
were shut up in little rooms without a seat, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
unfortunate women spent three days on a stone
pavement almost without food. Four of them were
confined under these terrible circumstances. Some
officers took an infernal pleasure in making us every
moment undergo the dread anticipation of death:
they made us line up, and the soldiers pretended they
were going to charge their rifles; then the officers
laughed and said the execution would be resumed on
the following morning. I am certain that some of
those who were thus detained went mad.</p>

<p>“But what a martyrdom was endured by the women
and children who saw their fathers, husbands or
brothers shot! All this went on with frightful
rapidity; in the twinkling of an eye, in spite of heart-rending
cries, the women and children were separated
from the men and ranged on the other side of the
Petite Place, then between the two groups were placed
the platoons which were to execute them; 153 wretched
people fell bleeding; six of these, of whom two had
not been touched by the bullets and four were only
slightly wounded, shammed death, but the officer
ordered the two who could still stand upright to rise,
as there would be no more firing. When the six
survivors obeyed, he gave the order, ‘Down with
them also!’ Then he had machine-guns fired at
the heaps of bodies. It is impossible to describe the
grief and the cries of the women and children, but the
monster who had given the order for this butchery
remained unmoved. ‘Ladies,’ he said, with a strong
German accent, ‘I have done my duty.’ Then off
he went with his men. The bodies must have lain
untouched on the square for three days; after this
interval they were buried on the very spot where
they had been executed. I took part in the work of
interment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<h3>At Louvain</h3>

<p>Several people who had been killed at Louvain by
the Germans had been buried by them on the square
in front of the railway station. The <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>
had the assurance to deny the fact. But search was
made, and the bodies of these victims of German
barbarism were discovered. The following account of
the exhumation was given by the <i>Tijd</i> of Amsterdam,
above the signature of a journalist who took part in
the work in the presence of several Belgians, Colonel
Lubbert, German commandant of Louvain, and his
aide-de-camp.</p>

<p>“Fortunately a fresh wind was blowing on that
day, as the stench which came out of the open tomb
was unbreatheable. The objects found on the bodies
were immediately thrust into a sack, which was duly
numbered. Twenty bodies were disinterred after
frightful labour; twenty bodies jammed into a hole
not more than four square metres in extent!</p>

<p>“We had to take infinite care not to collect legs or
arms belonging to other bodies, so much were the
limbs jumbled together.</p>

<p>“Emotion overwhelmed us all, but the German
Colonel Lubbert could not refrain from saying to
the burgomaster, ‘How such an event could have
taken place is incomprehensible when you think how
educated and cultivated our people are.’ And the
aide-de-camp added, ‘I am glad I was not at Louvain
during these tragic moments!’ Words which have
their value, and which show that plain people in
Germany now regret the indescribable act ordered
by their leaders, in contempt of the laws of the most
elementary humanity!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Professor Maldague, who was among the wretched
prisoners callously picked out one after another for
slaughter, and who had miraculously escaped death,
could not control the profound emotion which overwhelmed
him. On that fatal day the crowd of people
were forbidden to look at the atrocities committed by
civilised Germany, but a woman who happened to be
near Professor Maldague ventured nevertheless, and
saw that the victims marked out for expiation were
compelled to lie face downwards on the paving-stones.
Then they were killed by shots in the nape of the
neck, the back or the head.</p>

<p>“The majority of the victims consequently lay
with skulls fractured, not merely as a result of shots,
but of blows from the butt-end of rifles. Even that
was not enough. All the bodies which were recovered—the
medical reports assure us on this point—had
been pierced through with bayonet thrusts. Some had
their legs and arms broken. Two bodies only had no
wound. A post-mortem examination of them will be
made to discover the causes of death.</p>

<p>“Mme. Van Ertrijck then recognised at the edge
of the pit her husband, aged sixty years, the well-known
cigar manufacturer, and her son, aged twenty-seven
years; then appeared the bodies of a Belgian
soldier, who could not be identified, and of a young
lad not fifteen years old. The following victims were
afterwards identified: Charles Munkemer, husband of
Amélie Marant, born 1885; Edgard Bicquet, brewer
at Boort-Meerbeek, whose family, known throughout
Louvain, lives in the Rue de la Station; the retired
Belgian Major Eickhorn, aged sixty years, inventor
of short-range cartridges; A. Van de Gaer, O. Candries,
Mme. A. Bruyninckx, <i>née</i> Aug. Mariën; Mme. Perilleux,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
aged about sixty years. But on turning over the
ground we discovered a second tomb, which contained
seven other corpses concealed under thirty centimetres
of earth.</p>

<p>“On the next day the melancholy task was resumed.
In quite a small pit two more bodies were brought to
light: that of Henri Decorte, an artisan of Kessel-Loo,
and that of M. Van Bladel, curé of Hérent. There
was not a sound when the wretched priest’s tall form
was disinterred. R. P. Claes merely gasped, ‘The
curé of Hérent!’ The poor man was seventy-one
years old” (see the <i>Temps</i> of 5th February, 1915).</p>

<h3>At Nomény</h3>

<p>On the 20th August, 1914, the 8th Bavarian
Regiment entered Nomény in command of Colonel
Hannapel. “According to a story told by one of
their soldiers,” said the French Commission of Inquiry,
“their leaders had told them that the French tortured
the wounded by tearing out their eyes and gashing
their limbs. Thus they were in a fearful state of
unusual excitement. From all sides came the rattle
of rifle shots. The wretched inhabitants, whom the
dread of fire drove from their cellars, were shot down
like game, some in their domiciles and others on the
public road.</p>

<p>“Messrs. Sanson, Pierson, Lallemand, Adam, Jeanpierre,
Meunier, Schneider, Raymond, Dupoucel,
Hazatte, father and son, were murdered on the street
by rifle shots. M. Killian, seeing himself threatened
with a sabre stroke, put his hands on his neck to
protect himself. Three of his fingers were cut off
and his throat cut open. An old man of eighty-six
years old, M. Petitjean, who was seated in his armchair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was struck by a ball which cracked his skull,
and a German thrust Mme. Bertrand in front of the
body, saying to her, ‘You saw that ⸺!’ M.
Chardin, municipal councillor and acting mayor, was
ordered to supply a horse and carriage. He had
hardly promised to do all he could to comply, when
he was killed by a shot. M. Prevot, who saw the
Bavarians rushing into the chemist’s shop of which
he was in charge, told them that he was the chemist,
and that he would give them all that they wanted,
but three shots rang out and he fell with a heavy
groan. Two women who happened to be with him
escaped, but were pursued with blows from the butt-ends
of rifles up to the approaches to the railway
station, where they saw in the garden and on the
road many corpses heaped together.</p>

<p>“Between three and four o’clock in the afternoon
the Germans forced their way into Mme. François’
butcher’s shop. Thereupon she came out of her
cellar with her son Stub and an employee named
Contal. As soon as Stub came to the threshold of the
outside door he fell, seriously wounded by a rifle shot.
Then Contal, who escaped into the street, was immediately
murdered. Five minutes afterwards, as the
death-rattle was still in Stub’s throat, a soldier leant
over him and dispatched him with a blow of a hatchet
in the back.</p>

<p>“The most tragic incident of these horrible scenes
took place at the house of M. Vassé, who had gathered
together a number of people in his cellar in the
suburb called Nancy. About four o’clock a party
of about fifty soldiers forcibly entered the house,
bursting open the door and the windows, and immediately
set fire to it. The refugees then endeavoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to escape, but they were felled one after another at
the exit. M. Mentré was first murdered. His son
Léon then fell with his little sister, eight years old,
in his arms. As he was not quite dead, the end of
the barrel of a gun was put to his head and his brains
blown out. Then it was the turn of the Kieffer
family. The mother was wounded in the arm and
shoulder; the father, a little son of ten years old
and a little girl of three years old were shot. The
scoundrels fired at them again as they were lying on
the ground. Kieffer, who was lying on the ground,
got a fresh bullet in the forehead; his son had the
top of his skull blown off by a rifle shot. Then
M. Strieffert and Vassé, one of his sons, were murdered,
and M. Mentré was struck by three bullets, one in the
left leg, another in the arm on the same side, and a
third on the forehead, which was merely grazed.
M. Guillaume, who was dragged out into the street,
met his death there. Finally, a young girl called
Somonin, aged seventeen years, came out of the
cellar with her young sister Jeanne, aged three. The
latter had her elbow nearly carried off by a bullet.
The eldest threw herself on the ground and pretended
to be dead, remaining for five minutes in fearful
agony. A soldier kicked her and called out, ‘<i>Kaput</i>’
(done for).</p>

<p>“An officer came up at the end of this slaughter.
He ordered the women who were still alive to get up,
and called out to them, ‘Go to France.’”</p>

<h3>At Lunéville</h3>

<p>The murders at Lunéville were committed, according
to the French Commission of Inquiry, under the
following circumstances—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“On the 25th August, after firing two shots from
the inside of the Worms tannery, to make it appear
that they had been attacked, the Germans rushed into
a workshop of this manufactory, in which an artisan
named Goeury was working in company with Messrs.
Balastre, father and son. Goeury was dragged out
into the street, stripped, and brutally ill-treated,
whilst his two companions, discovered in the lavatory
where they had sought refuge, were shot.</p>

<p>“On the same day the soldiers came and called for
M. Steiner, who was concealed in his cellar. His
wife, in dread of some disaster, tried to keep him
back. As she clasped him in her arms she was struck
by a bullet in the neck. Some moments afterwards
Steiner, having obeyed the command which had been
given him, fell mortally wounded in his garden.
M. Kahn also was murdered in the garden of his
house. His mother, aged ninety-eight, whose body
was burnt to a cinder in the fire, had previously been
killed in her bed with a bayonet thrust, according to
the story of an individual who was acting as interpreter
to the enemy. M. Binder, who was going out
to get away from the flames, was also struck down.
The German by whom he was killed admitted that he
had wantonly killed him when the poor man was
quietly standing before a door. M. Vernier met with
the same fate as Binder.</p>

<p>“About three o’clock the Germans, breaking the
windows and firing shots, forced an entrance into a
house in which were Mme. Dujon, her daughter,
aged three, her two sons and a M. Gaumier. The
little girl just missed being killed; her face was
singed by a shot. At this moment Mme. Dujon,
seeing her youngest son lying on the ground, begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
him to get up and flee with her. She then noticed
that he was holding with full hands his intestines,
which were dropping out. The house was on fire and
the poor lad was burnt to a cinder, as was M. Gaumier,
who had been unable to escape.</p>

<p>“M. Wingstermann and his grandson, aged twelve,
who had gone to dig potatoes a little way off from
Lunéville, at a place called ‘les Mossus,’ in the
Chanteheux district, had the misfortune to meet the
Germans. The latter put them both against a wall
and shot them.</p>

<p>“Finally, about five o’clock in the evening, some
soldiers went into the house of a woman named Sibille,
in the same place, and without any excuse seized her
son, dragged him off 200 metres from the house, and
massacred both him and a M. Vallon, to whose
body they had bound him. A witness who saw the
murderers just when they were dragging off their
victim saw them return without him, and declared
that their bayonets were covered with blood and
pieces of flesh.</p>

<p>“On the same day a male nurse, named Monteils,
who was tending a wounded enemy officer at the
Lunéville hospital, was struck by a bullet in the
forehead as he was watching through the window a
German soldier firing rifle shots.</p>

<p>“On the following day, the 26th, M. Hammann
and his son, aged twenty-one years, were arrested at
their house and dragged outside by a gang who had
broken in the door and entered. The father was
unmercifully beaten, and as for the young man, when
he tried to struggle a non-commissioned officer cracked
his skull with a revolver shot.</p>

<p>“At 1 p.m. M. Riklin, a druggist, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
told that a man had fallen about thirty metres from
his shop, went to the spot and recognised in the
victim his own brother-in-law, M. Colin, aged sixty-eight
years, who had been struck in the stomach by
a bullet. The Germans alleged that this old man had
fired on them, but M. Riklin formally denies this
statement.</p>

<p>“Colin, he told us, was an inoffensive man absolutely
incapable of any act of aggression, and quite
ignorant of the use of firearms.</p>

<p>“The mind refuses to believe that all these massacres
took place without excuse,” continues the
French Commission of Inquiry. “That, however, is
the case. The Germans, it is true, have always given
the same excuse, alleging that civilians were the first
to fire on them. This allegation is false, and those
who have made it have been unable to make it appear
probable, even by firing rifle shots close to dwelling-houses,
as they were in the habit of doing so that
they might be able to declare that they had been
attacked by unoffending civilians upon whose ruin or
massacre they had decided. On many occasions we
obtained proof of this; the following, for example, is
one of many others. One evening, when a report
rang out while the Abbé Colin, curé of Croismare,
happened to be with an officer, the latter exclaimed,
‘That is sufficient reason, M. le Curé, why you and
the burgomaster should be shot and a farm burnt.
Look! there is one burning.’ ‘M. l’Officier,’ replied
the priest, ‘you are too intelligent not to recognise
the crack of your rifle. For my part, I do recognise
it.’ The German did not insist.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<h3>Outrages and Attacks on Hostages</h3>

<p>Before ending this chapter and putting on record
the admissions which German officers and soldiers
have involuntarily made on the subject with which
we are engaged, we may draw up two other categories
of criminal acts which they have committed: (1) the
practice of taking hostages, everywhere and on all
kinds of pretexts, some of whom were ill-treated and
killed, and (2) the callous deportation of civilians to
Germany.</p>

<p>To take hostages from among civilians whom the
fortune of war condemns to invasion is a thing so
cruel in itself that all civilised nations try to limit the
practice. The Germans, on the contrary, are noted
for the fact that they extend it as much as they can.
The name of hostages repeated everywhere gave a
melancholy significance to the Prussian barbarism of
1870. “<i>This practice</i>,” writes Bluntschli, “<i>is all the
more open to criticism, as it endangers the lives of
peaceful citizens without any fault of theirs, and, moreover,
without bringing any appreciable increase of
security</i>.” On the other hand, Geffcken writes: “<i>We
cannot approve of the practice by which in 1870 Germany
forcibly seized the chief people in enemy communes to
secure the railroads against attacks by francs-tireurs</i>.”</p>

<p>This opinion of German jurists, which is, moreover,
shared by all writers, has not prevented the Germans
from resorting in 1914 to the same practices as in
1870, and even adding thereto fresh cruelties.</p>

<p>In Belgium it was the clergy who principally served
as hostages. The majority of the Belgian priests who
had been ill-treated came under this category.</p>

<p>M. Hottier, mayor of Homécourt; M. Varin, curé<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
(both of whom were taken prisoner on the night of
the 3rd-4th August, 1914); MM. Alexis and Jean
Samain (of the <i>Souvenir Français</i>) were taken away
to Alsace and German Lorraine.</p>

<p>MM. Hottier and Varin had both been denounced
by a spy living at La Petite-Fin, whose reports served
as a pretext for the accusation made against them by
the German authorities.</p>

<p>Mayor and curé were first brought to Malancourt,
the seat of headquarters.</p>

<p>“My companion,” the mayor of Homécourt afterwards
told an editor of <i>L’Est Républicain</i>, “was
more unfortunate than I. He was not allowed time
to take his hat nor put on his stockings; he was clad
only in his cassock. He marched in a bad pair of
slippers. His colleague at Malancourt clothed the
wretched ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>“They searched me, seized my purse, which contained
a sum of twenty-seven francs, my papers…
But the acutest suffering which rent my heart was
when the hands of a Boche officer snatched my poor
ribbon of 1870, my humble decoration. It was as if
I had been punished with a lowering of rank.”</p>

<p>MM. Hottier and Varin were transferred to Metz
and brought before a court-martial. The former was
charged with having organised a campaign of francs-tireurs;
in regard to the latter, another complaint was
formulated—that he had urged some young people in
the annexed territories to enlist in the foreign legion.</p>

<p>The discussions ended in a double acquittal. But
M. Hottier was treated with no more consideration
on that account. For five days he was shut up in
a cell, getting only food that was uneatable. Fortunately
a generous intervention took place. M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Winsbach, an ex-chemist, succeeded in bringing
about some mitigation of the rigour of certain orders.
He enjoyed a high reputation at Metz. He used his
business connections, his influence, his knowledge of
the German and French languages sometimes to
recommend sick people to the care of the doctors,
sometimes to act as interpreter and express their
desires or pass on their explanations. These are services
which will never be forgotten by the hostages,
to whom M. Winsbach rendered them with unwearied
devotion.</p>

<p>The hostages were brought from Metz to Ehrenbreitstein,
where there were 232 French prisoners, all
natives of Metz, Thionville, etc. There were also the
brothers Samain, the eldest of whom was (until the
month of December) supposed in France to be dead,
executed by the Germans. He had tried in vain to
get news of himself brought through, but his correspondence
could not escape the fine net of supervision
which encompassed him.</p>

<p>The majority of these hostages carried away by the
Germans were detained by them. Only men of more
than sixty years of age were set free in the month of
November. M. Hottier and some of his companions
then set off on the 20th November, went through the
Grand Duchy of Baden, crossed the Swiss frontier,
and finally arrived at Nancy. The brothers Samain
were amongst those who were detained in Germany.</p>

<p>In France, almost everywhere he went, the invader
took hostages amongst the men of the villages or the
representatives of authority. In Belgium also several
people were carried off on the same plea.</p>

<p>Everybody knows of the case of M. Max, mayor of
Brussels, who was imprisoned at Glatz; but Brussels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
did not pay punctually the war tax which the Germans
had levied on it.</p>

<p>Often the hostages whom the Germans appeared to
have taken merely for the time of their passing
through disappeared. This was the case at Gueraid,
Seine-et-Marne, where, of six hostages whom the
Germans took, one only was able to escape and to
return to the country; and at Révigny, where one of
the hostages, a man named Wladimir Thomas, was
never set at liberty again.</p>

<p>In other cases the hostages were shamefully ill-treated.
M. Colin, a Professor of Science at the
Louis-le-Grand Lycée at Paris, who happened to be
rusticating at Cogney, was carried off barefoot and
in his shirt, loaded with insults as he went. Enraged
at the treatment which other people and especially
children were made to undergo, M. Colin said to a
lieutenant, “Have you not a mother?” “My
mother,” the German officer had the insolence to
reply, “did not give birth to ⸺ like you!”</p>

<p>The hostages taken at Lunéville were no less brutally
treated. Neither violence nor outrage was spared
these peaceful citizens. They were put with their
backs to the parapet of a bridge, before the houses in
the town were set fire to, and the German troops who
passed by behaved brutally to them. As an officer
accused them of having fired on the Germans, a
teacher among them pledged his word of honour that
it was not so. “You French ⸺,” said the officer,
“do not speak of honour, for you have none.” One
of the hostages taken at Lunéville, named Rebb
(sixty-two years of age), was pummelled on the face
with the butt-end of a rifle, and bayoneted in the
side. Nevertheless he continued to follow the column,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
although he lost much blood. Then a Bavarian
amused himself by inflicting fresh blows upon him
and throwing a bucket at his head.</p>

<p>The wretched old man died on the way, between
Hénaménil and Bures.</p>

<h3>Massacre of Hostages</h3>

<p>At Blamont in Lorraine, ex-Mayor Barthélemy,
aged forty-six years, was taken as a hostage and shot.
The same fate awaited the then mayor and the chief
people in the locality; when the French entered the
town they found notices on the walls announcing that
these people would be shot on the following morning.</p>

<p>This was also the case at Courtacon (Seine-et-Marne),
where five men and a child of thirteen years, taken
as hostages, were exposed to the French fire during
an engagement. Another hostage, named Rousseau,
a conscript of the 1914 class, arrested in the same
commune, was murdered under tragic conditions.</p>

<p>Questioned about the military position of this young
man, the mayor, who happened to be amongst the
hostages, replied that Rousseau had passed the military
court, that he had been passed as fit for service, but
that his class had not yet been called up. The Germans
then made the prisoner undress, in order to discover
what was his physical condition, then they put on
his trousers again and shot him fifty metres away
from his compatriots.</p>

<h3>Hostages in Serbia</h3>

<p>The hostages taken by the Austrians may be divided
into two categories. They were, in the first place, the
best-known Serbians, mayors or prominent inhabitants
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose imprisonment had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
no other object than to stop the invasion of that
province by the threat of shooting them. The second
category was composed of peasants, living in Serbian
villages, who were shot in order to strike terror into
the inhabitants. Amongst the hostages of the first
category several were shot. There were amongst
them priests, both Orthodox and Catholic, the Mayor
of Raguse, M. Tchingrin, the Vice-President of the
Municipal Council of this town, Dr. Puglissi, the poet,
and the Serbo-Croatian deputy, Tressitch.</p>

<p>As for the others, here is the story told by M. Reiss,
whom we mentioned above—</p>

<p>“A group of hostages of from eight to eighty-two
years had been brought to Lechnitza. There were 109
of them. Quite close to the railway station of the
place the soldiers dug a pit twenty metres long, three
wide and two deep. In front of this grave they placed
the group of 109 persons and bound them with ropes
round their necks. Then a squadron of infantry took
up a position on the slopes of the railway and fired a
volley at the peasants. The whole group stumbled
into the pit, and the soldiers threw earth upon them
without having first made sure that all those who had
been shot were dead. It is certain that a large number
of victims had not been mortally wounded and even
that some of them had not been struck at all. I
think I am not mistaken in calculating that fifty per
cent. of these poor people were buried alive.</p>

<p>“During these proceedings, another group of forty
hostages had been brought up. The latter were compelled
to be present at the massacre of their fellow-citizens
and they were forced to shout, whilst the
others were being killed, ‘Long live the Emperor
Franz-Joseph.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“I saw the pit opened into which these wretches
fell, and I was able to establish the fact that the
number of those who died of suffocation was very
large. This huge human bundle was firmly fastened
together: no rope had been broken.”</p>

<h3>Deportation of Civilians</h3>

<p>“The German military authorities had as profound
contempt for liberty as for human life. Almost
everywhere, people of every age were dragged from
their homes and led away to captivity. Many died
or were killed on the way.” These are the words in
which the French Commission of Inquiry denounces
that other crime committed by the Germans in the
territories which they had invaded. In several places
the inhabitants found they were deported <i>en masse</i> to
Germany to dig trenches or to replace German agricultural
labourers. In other places the inhabitants
were imprisoned. It is hardly necessary to say that
such acts are a violation of the law of nations in the
very point where it is most universally recognised.
We read in the articles of the Hague Convention that
operations of war may be carried on “provided the
inhabitants are not compelled to take part in them,
in any form whatever,” that “the occupant of a
country shall not raise reserves among them, nor
compel them to fight, nor put them in the trenches,
nor employ them on the offensive,” etc., and finally,
“that the peaceful and inoffensive inhabitants of the
territory and <i>passive</i> enemies must not be taken into
captivity.”</p>

<p>Although by carrying away hostages the Germans
have done violence to that rule of law which is accepted
by their own authors, the deportation of civilians is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
something more serious still, as it cannot be justified
by any military necessity or by any plea for security.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this policy was practised on a large
scale. The following are some examples. At Lebbeke,
in Flanders, forty-five farmers were brought away and
sent to Germany to make hay. At Boisschot, also in
Belgium, 200 men were seized and deported to Germany
for the same purpose. At Louvain, several
thousand men, who escaped the fusillades and the
conflagration, were led away to Germany.</p>

<p>In France, in the department of the Nord, at Saint
Pol-en-Ternois, 350 civilians were taken prisoner.
This was also the case at Douai, Cambrai, Caudry,
Noyon, where the German authorities demanded that
the young people of fifteen to seventeen years, a list
of whom had been supplied by spies, should be returned.
Those who failed to answer the summons
were sought for, and they and their parents were
shot. The inhabitants did as they were told, and
the young people to the number of 4000 were made
prisoner and brought to the Russian frontier to dig
trenches or else to the German countryside to make
hay.</p>

<p>At Marcheville, at Saint Mihiel, women and children
met with the same fate. At Avillers, too, all the
men of sixteen to sixty years were brought away to
Germany, including the deputy mayor, M. Alcide
Blaise.</p>

<p>As in the provinces of the Nord and Meuse, so also
in the Ardennes, the Germans made a regular practice
of putting the inhabitants in prison. In all the towns
and villages of this region men who were liable to
be mobilised were treated as prisoners of war. This
was the case at Rethel, where Dr. Bourgeois and ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of his colleagues had the experience of being shut up
in a spinning-mill with 400 men taken from the villages
of the province. The prisoners were compelled to
work for their enemies: they had to wash the soldiers’
linen, gather potatoes in the fields, and make earthworks.
At Charleville, men whom the Germans had
the assurance to call civil prisoners were employed
in making entrenchments, while the women, as we
have said above, were given sewing-work, which was
to be used for the equipment of the troops. Their
wage was half a loaf of bread.</p>

<p>In the province of Oise, about a hundred inhabitants
of Creil, Nogent-sur-Oise and the adjoining districts
were imprisoned, and had to submit to the disgrace
and vexation of working against their country, cutting
a field of maize, which might have been in the
way of the German fire, and digging trenches which
were to be used as shelters for the enemy. For the
seven days they were kept without food being dealt
out to them. Fortunately the women of the country
were able to get some provisions through to them.</p>

<p>At Lamath (Meurthe-et-Moselle), three inhabitants,
one of whom had chest complaint, were deported. At
Amiens, in particular, the scandal of incidents of this
kind was shocking. An order of the military authority,
which the mayor thoughtlessly countersigned,
required all citizens liable to be mobilised to go to
the citadel and declare their position as regards military
service. Relying on the mayor’s signature, about
1500 men, of whom nearly 800 were railway workers
at the Amiens passenger and goods stations, went to
the citadel. There the Germans made a selection.
They sent back the men of the auxiliary services and
kept the others as prisoners, to the number of more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
than 1000, whom they brought on foot to Personne.
The wretched procession halted and slept at La Motte-en-Santerre.
Some prisoners, with the assistance of
the few residents in Santerre, managed to hide and
make good their escape. The others were entrained
and taken away to Germany.</p>

<p>The second official report of the French Commission
of Inquiry is full of really shocking details of outrages
suffered by the French, who were taken from their
homes and interned in Germany (<i>Journal Officiel</i>,
11th March).</p>

<p>Ten thousand of these wretched people were reinstated
in French territory in the month of March.
The order for internment had included a very large
number of old men, children and women, several of
whom were pregnant. All of these people had to
submit to long and painful marches, ill-treatment and
wretched diet.</p>

<p>The Vareddes hostages especially went through a
veritable Calvary. Several of them, all old people,
were murdered, as we have already mentioned. Those
of Sinceny, about 200 in number, were likewise
shockingly ill-treated.</p>

<p>At Gravelines, 2000 conscripts were deported, and
all the natives of Combres, after being exposed to
the French fire, were transferred to the camp at
Zurickau.</p>

<p>Life in the camps was intolerable. Several of these
“civil prisoners” lay in tents: others were huddled
together in prisons. At Landau, an old woman aged
eighty-seven was undressed and drenched with petrol.
She succumbed some time afterwards to the fearful
burns which she sustained. Blows, ill-treatment and
painful forced labour were the order of the day. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
cannot, therefore, be surprised at the enormous number
of cases of death and illness among them. The only
medicine prescribed by the doctors was tincture of
iodine. As one of the victims said, “We were like
burnt-out candles, for we no longer had the strength
to stand upright.” Those who went back to France
had their health more or less permanently affected,
and the mental depression to which they were subject
was really an illness. The effects, therefore, of German
activity continued after they were released.</p>

<p>The Austrians followed the example of the Germans,
even in carrying out this kind of policy, especially in
Syrmie (Semlin and the regions adjoining).</p>

<p>At Chid, also, all the inhabitants, children excepted,
were deported: at Pazoon, M. Petrovitch, deputy to
the Parliament of Pest, was arrested with his son,
pummelled with the butt-end of a rifle, and deported.
At Karlowitz and at Rouma, all the inhabitants of
Serbian extraction were arrested and deported.</p>

<h3>The Germans admit all these Crimes</h3>

<p>As in the case of other kinds of outrage, so in that
of the actions which we have just enumerated we
are in possession of some admissions which have come
from the Germans themselves.</p>

<p>A soldier named Philip, of Kamenz in Saxony,
writes as follows: “At ten p.m. the first battalion
of the 178th regiment went down into a burnt
village to the north of Dinant, a sadly beautiful
spectacle, which made us shudder. At the entrance
to the village there lay about fifty citizens, who had
been shot for having fired on our troops from an
ambuscade.</p>

<p>“In the course of the night many others also were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
shot, to such an extent that we could count more
than 200 of them. Women and children, lamp in
hand, <i>were compelled</i> to look on at this fearful sight.
We then ate our rice in the middle of the dead bodies,
for we had had nothing to eat since morning.”</p>

<p>“At Leppes” (writes a Saxon officer, of the same
regiment as Private Philip, 12th army corps, 1st
Saxon corps), “<i>two hundred inhabitants were killed,
among whom there must have been some unoffending
people</i>. In future, we must have a regular inquiry and
establish the guilt of the accused before shooting
them.”</p>

<p>Even the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i> published the story of
an eye-witness of the destruction of Aerschot, who
would not have escaped had he not called out to the
soldiers, “Do you want to kill a man who comes
from Cologne?” The Germans then set him at
liberty again. “In the streets,” he writes, “the
fusillade lasted the whole night. <i>All those found in
possession of a weapon were mercilessly shot.</i> The sight
was terrifying … the wretches who were shot lay
on the pavement, and all the time fresh ‘<i>culprits</i>’
were being brought before the platoons charged with
the task of execution. Women and children wept and
asked for mercy. In spite of all their indignation at
the attack which had been made upon them, <i>no
German</i> heart could be untouched by pity for the
innocent victims.”</p>

<p>In the notebook of Private Hassemer of the 8th
corps we find this fearful confession—</p>

<p>“3rd September, 1914. At Sommepy (Marne),
dreadful slaughter, the village burnt to the ground,
the French thrown into the burning houses; civilians
and all burnt together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“On the third of September, at Creil,” writes a
German soldier of the 32nd reserve regiment of infantry,
“the iron bridge was blown up. For this reason we
set the streets on fire and shot civilians.”</p>

<p>The Saxon officer, some of whose narratives we have
already reproduced, also admits that the inhabitants
were not spared punishment by fire. “The fine village
of Gué-d’Hossus (Ardennes) has been consigned to
the flames, although it had committed no offence that
I can see. I have been told that a man on a bicycle
fell from his machine and that, in his fall, his gun
went off of itself, and then some one fired in his direction.
<i>After that men were simply thrown into the flames.
We must hope that atrocities of this kind shall not be
repeated.</i>”</p>

<p>“At Bouvignes, north of Dinant,” writes this Saxon
officer of the 178th Regiment of the Line, “we entered,
through a breach made in the rear, the grounds of a
well-to-do resident and occupied the house. Through
a labyrinth of rooms we reached the entrance of the
house. <i>There lay the body of the owner.</i> Outside, in
the fields, <i>the sight of the inhabitants who had been shot,
and whose bodies were lying on the ground, baffles all
description. The point-blank fusillade almost decapitated
them.</i> Each house was searched in the tiniest
corners and the residents dragged out from all their
hiding-places. <i>The men were shot.</i>”</p>

<p>The writer of this notebook alleges no pretext which
would excuse or explain, in his eyes, all these murders.
No more does the reservist Schlanter (3rd battery of
the 4th regiment of field artillery of the Guard)
mention any reason in justification of the murders
which he describes. He writes: “25th August. <i>In
Belgium, three hundred inhabitants of the town were shot.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Those who survived the volley were requisitioned to
act as grave-diggers (which proves that they were
not considered guilty). You should have seen the
women at this moment!”</p>

<p>“All the French, though civilians, were shot,” writes
another, “<i>if they only looked suspicious or ill-disposed</i>.
We shot them all: men and even young boys.”</p>

<p>“I have seen three convoys of French peasants
pass by,” writes a third; “all will be shot.” An
officer admits that the allegation that civilians took
part in the fighting is a mere excuse. “<i>We shall say</i>,”
he writes, “<i>that it was not the civilians who fired</i>, but
it was the custom-house officers and foresters.” The
same admission is also made by a Saxon officer of
the 178th regiment, who writes: “Near Lisogne, the
23rd August. The company lost its way. Our men
say that they could not advance any further, as
francs-tireurs were firing upon them from the houses.
<i>We seized these alleged francs-tireurs, placed them in three
ranks so that a single shot would hit three men at once.</i>”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Eberlein, who (in the <i>Münchener Neueste
Nachrichten</i>) tells the story of the barbarous manner
in which the troops entered Saint Dié, added on his
part: “Everybody who showed himself in the streets
was shot.” On the other hand, the commandant of
the garrison of Hay was so enraged at the disgraceful
conduct of the troops that he issued the following
order of the day, which constitutes a terrible accusation
against the Germans—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“25th August, 1914.</p>

<p>“Last night a terrible fusillade took place. It has
not been proved that the inhabitants of the town
were still in possession of arms. Neither has it been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
proved that civilians took part in the firing. <i>On the
contrary, according to all appearances the soldiers were
under the influence of alcohol, and opened fire through
incomprehensible fear of an enemy attack.</i></p>

<p>“<i>The conduct of the soldiers</i>, with few exceptions,
<i>appears to have been disgraceful</i>.</p>

<p>“When officers, or non-commissioned officers set
fire to houses without permission or order of the
commandant, or at least of the senior officer, and
encourage their troops to burn and pillage, it is an
act in the highest degree to be deplored.</p>

<p>“I expect that in every case strict instructions shall
be given as to the attitude to be observed towards
the life and property of civilians. I forbid any one
to fire into a town without the order of an officer.</p>

<p>“The regrettable conduct of the troops has had the
result that a non-commissioned officer and a soldier
have been seriously wounded by German fire.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Von Bassewitz</span> (Major),<br />
“Commandant.”</p>

</div>

<p>Even the proclamations issued by the German
authorities show for what hateful purposes the hostages
were taken away, and how precarious was their condition
as soon as the slightest check was inflicted on
the German troops, or the slightest attack was made
upon them.</p>

<p>“The life of hostages,” wrote Commandant Dieckmann
at Grivegnée, on the 6th September, “<i>depends
on whether the inhabitants of the communes previously
mentioned keep quiet under all circumstances</i>.” And he
adds, “I shall mark in the lists submitted to me the
names of those individuals who must stay as hostages
from noon on one day to noon of the next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“If a substitute has not been found within reasonable
time, the hostage will remain for a further twenty-four
in the fort. After this second period of twenty-four
hours, the hostage will run the risk of death, if a
substitute has not been found.”</p>

<p>Moreover, Marshal Von der Goltz, military governor
of Belgium, caused to be posted up in Brussels on
5th October, 1914, a proclamation in which the following
announcement was made: “In future, the localities
nearest to the place where the destruction of railway
lines and telegraph wires has taken place (<i>whether they
have been accessory or not</i>) will be mercilessly punished.
To this end hostages have been taken from all localities
near to railroads threatened by such attacks, and <i>at
the first attempt to destroy lines of railroad, telegraph or
telephone lines, they will be immediately shot</i>.”</p>

<p>As for the deportation of civilians and the imprisonment
with which they were threatened, when
they were not carried off to Germany, two German
soldiers volunteered the following admissions: “On
the 6th September,” writes one of them, “<i>we dispatched
three hundred Belgians to Germany, including twenty-one
curés</i>.” “We shut up,” writes the other (Karl Bertram
de Westeregein, near Magdeburg), “450 men in the
church at Aerschot. I myself happened to be near
the church at the moment.”</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>All this evidence and all these admissions are
sufficient to prove the criminal nature of the German
treatment of civilians whose territory had been invaded.
The pretexts which they allege have no validity. They
are only made for the sake of appearances, and, on
the other hand, the acts which they committed are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
such as admit no kind of excuse and can in no case
be justified. Nevertheless the German Government
attempted to do so. The Berlin Cabinet undertook to
prove that the inhabitants of Liège were guilty and
deserved to suffer the fearful butchery which followed
the entry of the Germans. To prove this the latter
relied upon the evidence of a certain Hermann Costen,
who was represented as a Swiss member of the Red
Cross. But the chief of the Swiss police promptly
published the following information—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) M. Hermann Costen never belonged to the
Swiss Red Cross.</p>

<p>(2) M. Hermann Costen is not Swiss, as he was
refused naturalisation.</p>

<p>(3) For two years M. Hermann Costen has been
under the surveillance of the Swiss police. I
maintain that since the declaration of war this
person only left Switzerland from the 9th to the
14th August. <i>It is absolutely impossible that he
can have been at Liège at the period of the siege
mentioned by you.</i></p>

<p>(4) M. Hermann Costen left Switzerland finally
in consequence of a decree of expulsion on the
19th September.</p>

<p>(5) M. Hermann Costen’s moral and material
credit is nil. He is an individual for whom there
is little to be said.</p>

</div>

<p>After the picture of German atrocities which has
been put before us, it is not without its uses to form
from this reply some idea of the duplicity which
endeavoured to cloak them.</p>

<span class="smaller">SYSTEMATIC ARSON. DESECRATION OF CHURCHES</span></h2>

<p>The life of the inhabitants of invaded countries,
the honour of their women, the liberty of their youths
were not the only blessings, which the Germans
attempted to take away from them in contempt of
all humanity and all law. Even the property of these
inhabitants suffered from invasion. They had to gaze
on the ruin of their ravaged homes, which the invader
left to be devoured by the flames, and when, deprived
of all their possessions, these wretched victims of
invasion wanted to take refuge in the temples of God,
this last resource was denied them, for the barbarians
had sometimes destroyed the church, and sometimes
taken possession of it to use as a barracks for their
soldiers.</p>

<h3>Arson as a Policy</h3>

<p>As the French Commission of Inquiry remarked,
arson was a common German practice, sometimes used
as a weapon of destruction, sometimes as a means of
intimidation. “The German army,” adds this Commission,
“in order to be prepared for it, has a regular
equipment, including torches, grenades, fuses, petrol-sprinklers,
rockets which carry inflammable matter,
and even little bags containing pastilles of a very
inflammable compressed powder. Its incendiary fury
is chiefly manifested against churches and monuments
interesting from the point of view of art or of history.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Often the invader was not content with sprinkling
the beds of dwelling-houses with petrol, he took care
also to heap straw under agricultural machines to
destroy them, as well as dwelling-houses, harvests, and
the cattle remaining in the stalls. This was done at
Château-sur-Morin by the 76th German regiment.</p>

<p>Often, also, arson was employed as a means to
compel people to leave their houses, and to make it
easier to pillage. As soon as they entered the villages
the Germans, with this object in view, set fire to them.
On other occasions they resorted to this method only
when the loot was over: then the destruction of the
houses of a village was only the crown of their work.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to record in detail acts of
this kind committed by Germans on all the invaded
territories. We must be content with noting those
cases in which parts of large towns were destroyed
and whole villages disappeared.</p>

<h3>Louvain</h3>

<p>The burning of Louvain must be regarded as an
operation distinct from the bombardment. The bombardment
was slight, but the burning fearful. The
burning began on the 26th August at ten p.m. It
was systematically carried out. In places where the
fire did not catch on, the soldiers went from house to
house throwing incendiary grenades.</p>

<p>The largest part of the town, especially those parts
of the upper town which included St. Peter’s Church,
the university and its library, the greater part of the
scientific institutions of the university, and the town
theatre were henceforth the prey of the flames.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that the academic library of
Louvain was one of the scientific treasures of Europe.</p>

<p>In token of peace all the houses in Louvain were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
flying a white flag, strips of which might be seen
floating over the ruins.</p>

<p>The fire was still going on the next day. Far from
taking measures to stop it, the Germans did all they
could to keep it going by throwing into the flames
all the straw they could find. On the 27th August
Louvain looked like an old city of ruins. Drunken
soldiers were walking about in it, carrying wine and
brandy. The officers, seated in armchairs round tables,
drinking like their men, looked on at the ominous
results of the disaster. In the streets, the bodies of
dead horses were decomposing in the sun, and the
stench of putrefaction from them mingled with that
of the fire, corrupted the air of the whole town.</p>

<p>The conflagration came to an end on the 2nd September.
On that day four more fires were lit by the
German soldiers in the Rue Leopold and the Rue
Marie-Thérèse. Eight hundred and ninety-four houses
were reduced to ashes within the precincts of the town
of Louvain, and about five hundred in the suburb
Kessel-Loo. The suburb of Berent and the commune
of Corbeek-Loo were almost entirely destroyed. The
suburb of Heverlé was the only one which was respected,
perhaps because the Duke of Arenberg, a German
subject, has property there.</p>

<p>The destruction of Louvain caused universal indignation,
as the destruction of the Cathedral of Reims
was to do a little later. In neutral countries public
opinion was roused.</p>

<p>In Sweden it was described as a “monstrous act of
barbarism against humanity and against civilisation.”
In Spain the press gave voice to unanimous protests
which recalled the fact that the Flemish treasures of
Louvain had been respected from the time of Philip II
to Napoleon I. The Portuguese Academy of Sciences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
invited the Academies of Science in all countries to
raise public subscriptions for the purchase of books
for the University of Louvain, and to keep alive the
protest of the intellectual world against an act of
destruction so barbarous. In America public feeling
was profoundly stirred. One newspaper made itself
the mouthpiece of general opinion on this topic when
it declared “Germany could not complain if her crimes
recoiled on her own head” (<i>New York Tribune</i>,
21st September, 1914). In Italy, finally, the <i>Giornale
d’Italia</i>, the <i>Messagero</i>, the <i>Secolo</i>, the <i>Mattino</i>, the
<i>Corriere della Sera</i>, the <i>Perseveranza</i>, the <i>Piccolo</i> (<i>de
Trieste</i>) and the <i>Avanti</i> signed a letter inviting the
citizens to testify their indignation at the Belgian
Legation at Rome.</p>

<h3>The Burning of Nomény</h3>

<p>Various crimes committed at Nomény have had
their place in foregoing chapters. But the burning of
the place surpassed them all. On the 13th August,
1914, at the cry “the Prussians, the Prussians,” the
inhabitants of this small village (in the province of
Meurthe-et-Moselle) took refuge in the cellars. The
German cavalry and infantry, sword unsheathed and
revolver in hand, rushed, shouting, into the village.
Mlle. Jacquemot, an eye-witness of these incidents, has
described them in the Nancy <i>Est Républicain</i> in these
words: “Having taken refuge in a cellar with thirteen
other persons, she was followed by the Germans, who
could not find where they had hidden. The Prussians,”
she said, “went up out of the cellar again, but it was to
sprinkle us with petrol through the vent-hole. They set
fire to it. We were choking. We should die by burning
or asphyxiation. We must go out at any cost. In
a choice of deaths it is better to die of a bullet or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
bayonet thrust. One of us has a watch. He looks
at it. It is five o’clock. We had been there for
seven hours! A couple of young girls (for, with the
women, there were only some children and old men)
offered themselves. Three of us then started out, the
two Mlles. Nicolas and I. We went out past the
outhouse. Everything in Nomény was on fire. The
whole street was in flames. We must not think of
going along the side of the street. Henceforth we
have only one hope, <i>i.e.</i> to gain the fields. We went
into the first garden we came to.</p>

<p>“As we went through the blazing streets, we had
seen dead upon dead. There were some whose heads
were split open. An old woman who would have been
a hundred years old in the month of November dropped
with exhaustion on the way. Of course she died. At
the Zambeau infirmary, some bread and a little sausage
meat were given us. We slept on the ground, and
this morning, Friday, about six o’clock, we had to go
packing.”</p>

<h3>Senlis</h3>

<p>The burning of Senlis is one of the most frightful
cases of destruction by fire of which the Germans
have been guilty. They had hardly entered it on
the 2nd September when they began to loot houses,
and afterwards threw into them special bombs which
caused fires to break out. As M. Émile Henriot has
shown, in <i>L’Illustration</i>, 26th September, 1914: “It
was not the bombardment that started the fire. A
callous and calculated purpose directed this work of
destruction. There are witnesses who affirm it, and
in some houses spared by the fire, these incendiary
bombs, which did not fulfil the mission, were found
afterwards. Private houses, hotels domiciles of rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and poor, modern villas or exquisite mansions of
former days—nothing was spared. The beautiful home
of the law courts and the sub-prefecture, which dated
from the time of Gabriel and Louis is no more.”
The cathedral, fortunately, was saved.</p>

<p>“Horror!” exclaimed M. Marcel Hutin of the <i>Echo
de Paris</i>; “the whole Rue de la République, the
principal street of Senlis, has been burnt down. Not
a house has been spared. The hotels, private dwelling-houses,
the castle, the town hall, the Houssaye Barracks—all,
all in ruins.</p>

<p>“On the first day of their arrival, after the bombardment
(I was told by the inhabitants, glad in the
midst of the mental and material affliction to see a
face from Paris) the Germans began to set fire to the
houses in the Rue de la République. On what pretext?
A tobacconist was alleged to have fired on
them, and the unfortunate mayor (M. Odent) to have
forgotten to cause all arms left in the possession of
the citizens to be sent to the town hall.</p>

<p>“And such scenes! Some soldiers deposited incendiary
bombs in the houses. Others, a few minutes
afterwards, fired on the houses, which, being full of
gases, immediately blew up. Nothing of them remains
but the walls.</p>

<p>“Scenes of bestial savagery lifted these brutes to
the highest pitch of joy: whilst the houses hard by
were ablaze and the fire had just reached the topmost
story of the Hôtel du Nord, in the basement a dozen
Death’s-Head Hussars, tipsy, were playing infernal
music on the piano, and singing with wild eyes. Outside
some cavalry were forcing their horses to leap
through these furnaces! It was frightful. All the
night I had a horrible vision of Senlis burnt down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<h3>Baccarat</h3>

<p>“On the morning after their arrival at Baccarat”
(on the 25th August, 1914), says M. Jean Rogier in
the <i>Petit Parisien</i>, “without excuse, without any pretext
that the population had fired on them—for the
mere lust of wickedness and destruction they set fire
to the town. To begin with, they made an attack on
the town hall. Soldiers bearing some resin torches,
others cans of oil and petrol, marched as if on parade,
to the town hall, splashed the walls with oil, emptied
the petrol into the offices and the basement, and then
threw their blazing torches into them.</p>

<p>“This hellish baptism accomplished, they waited.
Ah! not for long. The flames burst forth with a
fearful roaring noise, blackening the walls and rising
above the front like a fiery serpent, and soon all was
ablaze.</p>

<p>“This beautiful sight roused the brave soldiers.
Close to the mayor’s residence and along the whole
length of each side of the Rue des Deux Ponts there
were beautiful houses, the residences of middle-class
citizens. They sprinkled these sixty houses with
petrol and with oil and ran their torches against the
damp walls, and some minutes afterwards the whole
street was on fire. The flames leaped out of the cellars,
ran along the walls, rose, grew larger and larger and
climbed up to the roof. They joined each other from
one side of the street to the other, and, uniting, leaped
to the sky like pillars of fire. The whole air was red.
Flakes of flame sped outside the town, and left behind
a trail of smoke. Up there on the top of the church
the weathercock which revolved on the spire of the
ruined belfry gleamed like a jewel of iridescent stones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and all at once, in a din of thunder claps, all the houses
collapsed and shed on the town a rain of sparks.</p>

<p>“For five days the rubbish smoked.” One hundred
and two houses were burnt down.</p>

<h3>A Few Figures</h3>

<p>These narratives are eloquent and yet they are far
from giving an idea of the destruction which the
Germans left behind them. The figures tell us still
more than the narratives.</p>

<p>In Belgium, in fifteen towns and villages taken at
random among the localities which the Germans
systematically ravaged by fire, we note that 2191
houses were burnt: in other words, on an average
each Belgian locality damaged by the fire of German
torches had 146 houses burnt down. Moreover, we
have mentioned in our investigations, which were
made at haphazard, the names of ten Belgian localities
entirely destroyed by fire, including Tirlemont, Linsneau,
Andennes, Schaffer, Spontin, etc. It may easily be imagined
what would be the result of a systematic inquiry.</p>

<p>In France, the number of villages completely burnt
down like Nomény, Sommeilles, etc., was very great.</p>

<p>Some idea of the damage done may be formed from
the fact that in the Meurthe-et-Moselle province alone
twenty-two places suffered from fire. Of these twenty-two,
two were completely destroyed (Villers-aux-Vents
and Sommeilles), and in the other twenty, 663 houses
were burnt. This gives an average of twenty-three
houses a district.</p>

<h3>Burning of Historic Monuments and Castles</h3>

<p>It was not merely at Reims during the bombardment,
and at Louvain during the fire, that the Germans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
showed their contempt for monuments and the treasures
of art and science contained in them. In the following
chapter we shall take note of the loot carried on in
the interiors of these buildings. Here we speak only
of fire and general destruction. Several castles were
burnt down: those of Varolles, Moque-Souris, Sparre
(in Chierry), the château of Brumetz (Aisne province),
the town hall of Lunéville, the house of M. Alberic
Magnard, author of <i>Bérénice</i> (at Baron), who saw all
the works of art accumulated there, in value exceeding
a million francs, destroyed by fire. In Poland, the
town hall of Szydlowice, an architectural masterpiece,
was destroyed, notwithstanding the 5000 crowns which
the inhabitants of the place paid to the German
commandant to secure its preservation.</p>

<h3>Sacrilegious Fires</h3>

<p>None the more were churches spared. The invader,
the enemy alike of his foe’s taste and of his religious
faith, spent as it were a double ferocity on the work
of destroying the temples of God.</p>

<p>“The church at Aerschot,” writes the Belgian
Commission of Inquiry in one of its reports, “is a
lamentable spectacle. Its three entrances and those
of the sacristy have been more or less consumed.
The entrance leading to the nave, and the side entrance
on the right, both of massive oak, seem to have been
hammered with a battering-ram after the flames had
reached them.”</p>

<p>The same was the case at Révigny, the church which
was classed among historic monuments, and in many
other Belgian and French villages which, when they
were totally or partially destroyed by fire, also lost
the home of their religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<h3>Desecration of Churches</h3>

<p>The Germans were not content with destruction.
On several occasions they went out of their way to
desecrate holy places; so much perversity, worse even
than barbarism, is there in the regular habits of this
nation and in the education which they receive.</p>

<p>The church of Aerschot was not merely burned, it
was also polluted; and the following narrative, given
by a woman who was an eye-witness, a correspondent
of the <i>Evening News</i> (of 24th September, 1914), will
help to give us some idea of what went on there—</p>

<p>“On the high altar,” wrote this journalist, “there
were three empty champagne bottles, two rum, a
broken bordeaux bottle and five beer bottles. In
the confessionals other champagne, brandy and beer
bottles, also empty.</p>

<p>“On the marble flags, heaps of straw everywhere,
heaps of bottles, rubbish and filth. On the forms, on
the chairs, bottles and still more bottles, champagne,
beer, rum, bordeaux, burgundy and brandy. In all
directions wherever we cast our eyes, to whatever
part of the church we looked, there were nothing but
bottles by the hundred, by the thousand, perhaps;
everywhere bottles, bottles, bottles.</p>

<p>“But the sacristan in a trembling voice appealed
to me. ‘Madame, do look!’ and he showed me a
white marble bas-relief representing the Virgin. They
had quite broken the head of the Virgin!</p>

<p>“A little further away there were splendid wood
carvings, representing an episode in the life of Christ.
They burnt the face and half the body of Christ!
Why? For the mere pleasure of destruction, as they
slashed with the sword or bayonet the tapestries and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
costly lace which covered the altar. On the walls
hung priceless paintings, the work of Flemish old
masters. These they cut along the frames.</p>

<p>“They brought a pig into a little chapel, to the
right of the nave, and killed it there.</p>

<p>“On all sides the walls and flagstones bore the
marks of prancing horses which had been stabled in
the sanctuary.” A pyx was taken away by the
Germans from the church of Hofstade. A Belgian
priest found the gilt copper foot of it on the way into
the village. All the precious stones which adorned it
had been taken away, and the Germans also kept the
upper part of silver gilt.</p>

<p>In France, likewise, churches were desecrated, and
the Germans used that of Betz as a barracks. When
they had gone, one could see in it straw mattresses
lying on the flagstones, empty bottles in rows on the
altar steps, the remains of food on the forms and
chairs, a leg-of-mutton bone thrown into the font,
etc.</p>

<p>On the 25th October a battalion of the 123rd
infantry regiment of Wurtemburg Landwehr entered
the village of Seugern, at the bottom of the Guebwiller
valley and, on a signal from their leader, immediately
set fire to it. The latter, a lieutenant, reserved for
himself the church, which he entered at the head of
ten men. In obedience to their officer’s orders the
gang started operations by destroying the organ,
then broke down the confessionals and the high altar,
and, making a heap of images in the nave, drenched
them all with petrol.</p>

<p>A single Catholic soldier refused to take part in this
infamous work. He was, therefore, disarmed and shot
the following morning. The arrival of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Chasseurs Alpins fortunately prevented the church,
which had been polluted, from being devoured by fire
as well.</p>

<p>The little church of Vitrimont (a league away from
Vitrimont) was also desecrated by the Germans. Its
stained glass was shattered, its door smashed to pieces,
and in the nave the sacrilegious invaders left nothing
but a confused heap of timber, plaster, jagged benches,
broken glass. Vestments of the priests, the images of
the saints, the costly cloths, the beautiful embroidered
work, the trimmings of the altar, and the tiny treasure
of the sacristy were all found on the road in the mud.</p>

<h3>In Russia</h3>

<p>Instances of desecration of churches, Orthodox and
Catholic, were still more numerous in Russia. The
cause of this lies in the orders which were given to
attack the Russian or Polish peasant through his
religion, the most sacred of his possessions.</p>

<p>The worst of these outrages was that suffered by
the famous church of Our Lady at Tchenstokhova.
It is the great centre of national pilgrimage, to which
more than a million people go each year. The Germans
did not shrink from desecrating this renowned sanctuary
and looting the famous convent of the Virgin.
In particular the two churches at Radom (in the
province of Kielce) suffered from the German invasion.
The soldiers, who spent the night there, littered the
ground with straw, broke the locks of the drawers
and the chests, smashed the various images and left
everything in frightful disorder.</p>

<p>At Mlava the churches and synagogues were converted
into barracks. At Souvalki, after the Germans
had gone, it was shown that they had made a stable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of the church, for round about were lying the droppings
of horses, and hooks and rings had been fastened
to the walls. On the altar there were traces of a
meal; beside the shattered remnants of the clock
several empty bottles and dirty cloths had been left
behind, and there were marks of filthy stains. The
vestments of the priests had been used to cover
horses; the sacrilegious plunderers had carried off the
candelabra and the altar cloth.</p>

<p>At Calvaire (in the province of Kovno) the Germans
threw the altar-piece, the cross, and various other
images into the privies. At Grasewo, Krasno, Topoleza,
Konsk and Kielce, similar acts were noted. At
Mariampol (in the province of Kovno) the Germans
sacked the college library, forced their way into the
church and desecrated the altar by dining at it. The
remains of this dinner and dirty stockings were found
under the altar.</p>

<p>Finally, at Volkawisky two churches were desecrated.
One was sacked and its silver cross stolen;
the other, the regimental church, was converted into
a barracks, and the priests’ vestments were used as
dishcloths.</p>

<h3>German Admissions</h3>

<p>We must not omit the chapter of admissions. So
far as the burning of Aerschot is concerned, we find
one of these admissions in the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>,
whose correspondent admits that “the sight was
alarming.” He adds that “the town was ablaze on
all sides” and that “the barrels of spirits of wine
blew up with a deafening clatter.”</p>

<p>The Saxon officer of the 178th regiment, whose
evidence we have already put on record, writes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
“<i>the fine village of Gué-d’Hossus (Ardennes) was abandoned
to the flames, although so far as I could see it
was innocent</i>.”</p>

<p>A soldier of the 32nd reserve infantry regiment
notes in his pocket-book that “<i>the streets of Creil were
burnt down</i>” by way of reprisals and because the iron
bridge was blown up.</p>

<p>A soldier of the reserve named Schaulter writes:
“The crack of rifle shots was heard when we left
Ovela, but, in it, <i>fire</i>, <i>women</i>, and our leavings.” So
common was the practice of which he mentions one
result, that he did not think it necessary to give any
details. Arson, pillage, sacrilege, violation, such were
the solemn rites of invasion.</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officer, Hermann Levith, of
the 160th infantry regiment, 8th corps, says that “the
enemy occupied the village of Bièvre,” and adds,
“<i>We took the village, then burnt nearly all the houses</i>.”
Another, Private Schiller, of the 133rd infantry
regiment, 19th corps, writes: “It was at Haybes
(Ardennes) that on the 24th August, we had our first
battle. The second battalion entered the village,
<i>searched the houses, sacked them and burnt those from
which any one had fired</i>.” A Bavarian soldier, Reishaupt,
of the 3rd infantry regiment, 1st Bavarian
corps, writes: “Parux (Meurthe-et-Moselle) was the
first village we burnt; after that the dance began—one
village after another.”</p>

<p>Would it not have been believed that setting fire
to a country was part of the methods of attack and
of acts permitted to a conqueror? What formerly
was an exceptional occurrence, which remained in
the memory of men as an unheard-of crime, is in
German eyes the usual way of war.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">SYSTEMATIC PILLAGE AND THEFT. ROBBING THE
WOUNDED AND THE DEAD</span></h2>

<h3>The German Idea of War-booty</h3>

<p>The cherished idea of the German soldier is that
war permits and excuses everything. Consequently
the property of the inhabitants of the territory he
invades does not seem to him to be immune from his
cupidity. If the lust of possession seizes him, he thinks
it is a brilliantly won booty, which rewards him for
his efforts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, international law only recognises as
booty what is taken from a <i>state</i>; in all other cases
it is pillage, and Bluntschli, the well-known German
jurist, stigmatises it as emphatically as any one.</p>

<p>Let us add that it is not merely the German private
soldier who shows that he is capable of this violation
of law. The officer and even the general share this
view, and commit this crime. In the majority of
these cases pillage was not an accident, but a system,
and has taken place under such conditions that it
could not have been carried out if the officers had not
approved of it. In many cases it was they who set
the example. Pillage was reduced by them to the
movements of a military operation. The narratives
which will follow will make that clear. For the present,
we shall quote the letter of the wife of a German officer
living in Berlin, which the Spanish Embassy at Berne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
received during the month of January, in which this
woman admitted that she was in possession of a quantity
of <i>objets d’art</i>, of which she supplied an inventory.
These articles her husband had sent her after the sack
of a château in France. She added that her husband
had taken these articles to leave them in safety with
her, that her conscience would not allow her to keep
them without giving a list of them, and that she wished
to see them restored to their owner after the conclusion
of hostilities.</p>

<p>In conformity with this evidence, the French Commission
of Inquiry declared that “in every place
through which a company of the enemy passed they
gave themselves up to a methodically organised pillage,
in the presence of their leaders, and sometimes even
with their active assistance.”</p>

<h3>The Objects of Pillage</h3>

<p>Pillage covered everything, everything at least
that could be carried away. What could be consumed
was used at once, letters were everywhere pillaged.
“Strong-boxes,” said the Commission of Inquiry,
“have been gutted, and considerable sums robbed or
taken by violence from them. A large quantity of
silver and jewels, and also of pictures, furniture,
<i>objets d’art</i>, linen, bicycles, women’s clothes, sewing-machines,
and even children’s toys, have been taken
away and put on wagons, to be brought to the
frontier.”</p>

<p>The <i>Temps</i> gave an inventory of articles found in
two trunks carried off in a motor by German soldiers.
This booty came from Belgium.</p>

<p>“First trunk: four table-cloths marked M. S., one
sheet, one woman’s chemise marked M. B., two
petticoats, one white-and-red bodice, one dress-bodice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and velvet skirt marked ‘Maison Richard Ruelens,
rue des Joyeuses-Entrées 36, Louvain’; two blouses,
a skirt and jacket of velvet, four gowns, a muff, a
woollen necktie, the back of a pedestal, two electroplated
teapots, a silver coffee-pot, a porcelain article,
a teacup, table-knives with silver handles, and a
dessert-knife.</p>

<p>“Second trunk: a bronze figure of a Cossack with
inscription in Russian characters, four cases containing
table-knives, a silver tray, two nickel candlesticks, a
small mirror, two revolvers, four swords, seven pairs
of ladies’ boots, two pairs of high-heeled shoes, a notebook
in which was written on the first page ‘<i>21st July:
paid 10 fr. 80</i>’; a registration book of the State Railway
Co.; two white petticoats, four of which were marked
L. S.; two muffs, a stole, five dress-bodices, one of
which was marked ‘Maison Richard Ruelens, rue des
Joyeuses-Entrées 36, Louvain’; a black evening
cloak, a woman’s nightgown marked M. B., two
table-cloths, two ostrich feathers, an evening dress,
a child’s embroidered dress, four pairs of stockings, a
reticule with the price 1.35 marked on a label, an
overcoat with silk lapels marked ‘Maison Février,
Maubeuge.’”</p>

<p>The result of such acts was that the not-too-opulent
inhabitants of Belgium and north-east France lost
all they had. The looters carried off what was not
devoured by the flames, and it must be added that the
work of pillage, no less than of massacre, rape and arson,
was carried out with even greater fury when the
inhabitants thought they had stalled it off by their
entreaties. The fact has been noticed, especially in
Belgium, that houses which bore inscriptions like
“Please spare,” or “Decent people; do not plunder
them,” were sacked and pillaged first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>The most conspicuous acts of this kind took
place in Belgium at Louvain, Aerschot and Dinant;
in France at Lunéville, Clermont-en-Argonne, and
Château-Thierry.</p>

<h3>Pillage a General Practice</h3>

<p>Other towns and villages saw acts like these repeated
many times. Here are some examples taken at
random.</p>

<p>In the Province of Aisne, the village of Brumetz was
sacked; in that of Jaulgonne, the Prussian Guard
emptied cellars and carried off linen: theft and destruction
combined resulted in loss to the extent of 250,000
francs. At Charmel similar incidents occurred. At
Péronne, the inhabitants had to endure levies imposed
on them without ceasing. All inhabited houses were
searched from cellar to attic and stripped bare. Shops
that were found shut were forced open. Whole trains
full of stolen furniture were brought away to Germany.</p>

<p>At Baccarat it was the same. Everything that the
German soldier thought right to take was taken. They
took wine and flour. At the glassworks the finest
articles, cut-glass services, were packed up with a
care which showed every characteristic but blind
violence, and packed on wagons directed to Sarrebourg.
Carts laden with furniture also took the
same road.</p>

<p>At Barbery and at Charmont men forced their way
into the rooms of private houses, having first turned
out the residents. Furniture and family property—all
were taken, and thrown out of the windows or carried
off. The village of Bussières, near Château-Thierry,
was completely destroyed, of set purpose. The
Prussians pillaged there everything they could find.
The remainder was destroyed, pulled about, broken up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
carried off, smashed to atoms by a kind of savagery.
Then it was set on fire, and the flames finished the work
of devastation.</p>

<p>At Albert, Captain Zirgow from the 30th August
authorised the soldiers under his command to visit,
so he said, unoccupied houses. This was as much
as to give them <i>carte blanche</i> for pillage and theft.
Consequently the booty taken by the Germans in this
district was of great value.</p>

<p>The town of Coulommiers was widely pillaged; silver,
linen, boots were taken away, especially from deserted
houses, and many bicycles were packed on motor-lorries.</p>

<p>At Rebais a jeweller’s shop was sacked.</p>

<p>At Nomény, before burning the town the Germans
took out of the dwelling-houses all that they thought
worth carrying away. They sent everything to Metz.
At Beauzemont, the château was looted by officers
of the German general staff, accompanied by their
wives; at Drouville, at Hériménil, at Jolivet, there
was systematic pillage. In the last locality a sum of
600 francs was stolen by a German.</p>

<p>At Choisy-au-Bac, in Valois, the German soldiers,
in presence of their officers, gave themselves up to
general pillage, the fruits of which were carried off in
carriages stolen from the inhabitants. Two military
doctors wearing the Red-Cross brassard with their
own hands pillaged Mme. Binder’s house.</p>

<p>At Trumilly the looting was carried out in perfect
order. A non-commissioned officer on the general
staff of the 19th regiment of Hanoverian Dragoons
robbed Mme. Huet of 10,000 francs’ worth of jewels.
The German colonel, to whom this lady made complaint,
approved of the non-commissioned officer’s
action. Another German soldier of the 91st infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
regiment was guilty of several thefts to the value of
815 francs. And these cases were not the only ones
clearly proved in this district.</p>

<h3>Looting of Louvain</h3>

<p>During the days which followed the burning of
Louvain, the houses which remained standing and
whose inhabitants had been driven out were handed
over to be looted under the very eyes of the German
officers.</p>

<p>This pillage lasted eight days. In bands of six or
eight the soldiers forced in the doors or broke in the
windows, rushed into the cellars, soaked themselves
in wine, threw the furniture about, broke open safes,
stole money, pictures, <i>objets d’art</i>, silver, linen,
clothing, provisions.</p>

<p>A great part of this booty was loaded on military
wagons and carried off to Germany by railroad.</p>

<h3>Looting at Aerschot</h3>

<p>M. Orts, Adviser to the Legation, Secretary of the
Belgian Commission of Inquiry, stated that the town
of Aerschot was partially destroyed by fire, but that
so far as the rest was concerned, he could affirm that
it had been completely sacked.</p>

<p>“I went into several houses,” he said, “and passed
through the different storeys. Everywhere the furniture
had been thrown about, gutted, polluted in a disgraceful
manner. Paper-hangings fell in strips from
the walls, the doors of the cellars were burst in, the
locks of the chests, drawers, and all the cupboards had
been picked and their contents taken. Linen, articles
of the most different kinds, and an incredible number
of empty bottles covered the ground.</p>

<p>“In the middle-class houses, pictures were slashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and works of art broken. On the door of one, a huge,
fine-looking building belonging to Dr. X, the following
inscription, half rubbed out, might still be read in
chalk: ‘Please spare this house, as the people in it
are really peaceable, decent folks. Signed, Bannach,
Orderly.’ I went into this building, in which I was told
some officers had been billeted, and which the kindness
of one of them appeared to have saved from the
general destruction. On the threshold a faint smell
of spilt wine called attention to hundreds of empty
or broken bottles, which were heaped up in the porch
or the staircase and in the court leading into the
garden. Unspeakable disorder reigned throughout
the rooms; I walked on a layer of torn clothing and
tufts of wool which had fallen out of the gutted
mattresses. Everywhere furniture smashed open, and
in all the rooms within reach of the bed more empty
bottles. The dining-room was heaped with them,
dozens of wine-glasses covered the large table and the
smaller ones which pressed against the slashed armchairs
and sofas, while in the corner a piano with dirty
keys seemed to have been smashed with kicks of a
jackboot. Everything showed that these places had
been for many days and nights the scene of shameless
debauchery and drinking-bouts. On the Place du
Marché the interior of the house of M. X, a solicitor,
presented a similar appearance, and, according to the
statement made to me by a quartermaster of gendarmerie,
who, with his men, tried to restore a little
order into all the chaos, it was the same with the
majority of houses belonging to prominent families
in which the German officers had chosen to take up
their quarters.</p>

<p>“All valuables which their owners had not had
time to put in a place of safety—silver, family jewels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
loose money—disappeared, and the inhabitants declare
that arson <i>frequently had no other purpose</i> than to
<i>destroy the proofs of unusually serious thefts</i>. Wagons,
packed full with loads of booty, left Aerschot in the
direction of the Meuse.”</p>

<h3>Looting at Dinant</h3>

<p>The Dutch journalist whom we have quoted writes
in the <i>Telegraaf</i> with regard to this town—</p>

<p>“In the Banque Henri the Germans had a disappointment,
for they could not find where the safe
had been concealed, but they stopped the manager and
his son at the very moment when they were trying to
escape on bicycles. As they refused to reveal the
secret, they were killed with revolver shots. At
the Banque Populaire the Germans, indeed, found the
safe, but the greatest part of the money which it contained
had already been transferred to a place of
safety. The brigandage carried on was frightful, and
to find a parallel to it we should have to go back to
the days of the blackest barbarism.”</p>

<h3>Looting at Lunéville</h3>

<p>“During the early days,” says the French Commission
of Inquiry, “the Germans were content to
pillage, without otherwise molesting the inhabitants.
Particularly was this the case on the 24th August,
when Madame Jeaumont’s house was stripped. The
stolen articles were put in a great cart, in which were
three women, one clad in black, the other two wearing
military costumes, and having the appearance, we were
told, of canteen-attendants.</p>

<p>“On the 25th August, M. Lenoir, aged sixty-seven
years, was brought out into the fields with his wife,
their hands tied behind their backs. After both had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
been cruelly ill-treated, a non-commissioned officer
took possession of a sum of 1800 francs in gold which
Lenoir had about him. Indeed, the most audacious theft,
as we have already said, seems to have been part of
the habits of the German army, who made a regular
practice of it. The following is an interesting example—</p>

<p>“During the burning of a house belonging to
Madame Leclerc, the safes of two tenants had resisted
the flames. One, belonging to M. George, under-inspector
of waterworks and forests, had fallen into
the ruins; the other, owned by M. Goudchau, estate-agent,
remained fastened to a wall on the second storey.
Non-commissioned officer Weiss, who knew the town
well, as he had often been well received there when he
visited it before the war in his capacity as hop-merchant,
came back with his men to the place, gave orders to
blow up with dynamite the piece of wall which remained
standing, and made sure that the two safes should be
brought to the station, where they were placed in a
wagon bound for Germany. This Weiss was in the
special confidence and favour of the commandant.
It was he who at the quarters of the commandant had
the duty of administering the commune in some sort
of fashion and of arranging for levies.”</p>

<h3>Looting of Clermont-en-Argonne</h3>

<p>Let us quote the Commission of Inquiry—</p>

<p>“On the 4th September, during the night the
121st and 122nd Wurtemberg regiments entered,
breaking the doors of the houses as they passed, and
giving themselves up to unrestrained pillage, which
was to continue during the whole of the following day.
Towards midday a soldier kindled the fire. When
the fire had gone out, pillage recommenced in the
houses spared by the flames. Articles of furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
taken from the house of M. Desforges, fabrics stolen
from the shop of M. Nordman, linen-draper, were
piled up in the motors. A surgeon-major took all
the hospital dressing materials, and a commissioned
officer, after writing at the entrance to the Lebondidier’s
house a notice forbidding pillage, caused a large part of
the furniture with which this mansion was furnished to
be taken away in a cart, intending them, as he boasted
without shame, for the adornment of his own villa.</p>

<p>“At the time when all these incidents took place
the town of Clermont-en-Argonne was occupied by
the 13th Wurtemberg corps under the orders of
General von Durach, and by a troop of Uhlans, under
command of the Prince of Wittenstein.”</p>

<h3>Looting of Château-Thierry</h3>

<p>Château-Thierry was looted in the presence of
officers, who must even have taken part in it, if we
are to judge by the example of two German doctors,
surprised in town by the arrival of the French troops,
and who were then included in an exchange of
prisoners. Their cases were opened, and in them were
found articles of clothing obtained by looting shops.</p>

<p>“During the whole week which the German occupation
of Château-Thierry lasted,” wrote the <i>Temps</i>
of the 25th October, 1914, “shops and rooms were
methodically pillaged; jewellers and bazaar owners
were plundered most of all. Patients under treatment
in the Red Cross hospital whose wounds did not
prevent them walking, went through the town all day,
thieving here and there, and then returned in the
evening with their booty to sleep in hospital.</p>

<p>“One day they offered Mlle. X some bonbons which
they had just stolen, and they appeared much surprised
when the young Frenchwoman refused their present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lorries loaded with stolen articles were lined up
on the road to Soissons as far as the eye could reach.
A non-commissioned officer and four men were seen
to drag along a little English cart, nicely fitted, quite
loaded with booty.</p>

<p>“Needless to say, the cellars were completely
emptied. Not a single pot of preserve at Château-Thierry;
blankets, sheets, table-cloths, napkins—everything
was carried off. The Château of Belle-Vue,
which belongs to M. Jules Henriet, was not burnt, but
everything in it was plundered. Chests, desks, all the
furniture were forced open. As for silver, for the most
part it disappeared from the houses that were sacked.”</p>

<h3>Serbia and Russia</h3>

<p>The same kind of thing took place in Poland and
Serbia. At Chabatz the shops were broken open and
the goods which they contained stolen.</p>

<p>In the Report of the Serbian Commission of Inquiry
it is said that at Prngnavor and in the outskirts all
the furniture of the inhabitants, such as beds, chests,
chairs, tables, sewing-machines, and even stoves had
been completely smashed and thrown outside the
houses. The Commission also declared that all the
domestic animals which had not been used for food
or taken away were slaughtered.</p>

<h3>Theft of Pictures and Various Objets d’Art</h3>

<p><i>Objets d’art</i> of every kind and pictures were several
times stolen in this way both in Belgium and in France.
The review <i>Kunst und Künstler</i>, in an article from the
pen of Professor Shaeffer, who goes so far as to specify
the pictures which ought to figure in German museums,
proclaimed the right to take possession of such articles
and bring them to Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true that in museums the greater part of the
exhibits had been put in a place of safety. Others
were surprised and looted. This was the case with the
Oberot Museum at Brussels. The following is the
account of the incident given by Mme. Latour, wife
of the Director of the Museum.</p>

<p>“All the keepers had gone to the battlefield, and
my husband and I were alone. Seeing that they were
going to beat in the door, my husband decided to open
it for them. First of all he had taken the precaution
to lock the door into the galleries.</p>

<p>“Without paying the slightest attention to him, the
officers immediately went to that in which priceless
enamels of the twelfth century and magnificent jewels
had usually been exhibited. Not being able to get
in, they condescended to ask for the key. My husband
refused. They took hold of him and forcibly deprived
him of the bunch which he had in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Once inside, when they noticed that certain
articles which they doubtless coveted had disappeared,
they waxed furious. This, however, did not prevent
their taking whatever they liked from the glass cases,
some pictures, and some porcelain specimens, which
they then compelled me to pack up for them.</p>

<p>“Moreover, they did not attempt to conceal the
fact that what they were stealing would later on adorn
their own houses.</p>

<p>“‘That would suit very well in my drawing-room,
and this in my wife’s bedroom,’ said one. ‘Martha
asked me to bring her some real Brussels lace,’ replied
the other, ‘but I shall bring her this exquisite
miniature. She will be delighted…’</p>

<p>“Every day for more than a fortnight they came
back like that, sometimes alone, sometimes accompanied
by other officers or soldiers, and every time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
they brought away something from the museum.
They took away not less than fifty pictures.</p>

<p>“My husband once managed to get into conversation
with one of the secretaries of the Military Governor of
Brussels, and complained bitterly of the scandalous
thefts committed every day at the museum. But this
German official refused to listen to the description
which M. Latour gave him of the officers and their
uniforms. At last he brought him to the door with
these words, ‘Woe to the vanquished!’”</p>

<p>The Germans took the furniture of the Government
offices, and also all the stage properties of the Park
Royal Theatre, the stage of which was converted into
a motor garage.</p>

<p>They took away the following articles from the
château at Compiègne—</p>

<p>Sixteen large pieces, eight in coral and eight in
lava, which belonged to Napoleon I’s chessboard; a
chased and gilt bronze figure of Atalanta above a
clock; a chased and gilt bronze socket, part of a
candelabrum on Sèvres porcelain; a chased gold and
steel case containing a poniard, knife and fork, part of
a collection of arms; a poniard; a Turkish dagger;
a chased silvered case, adorned with precious stones,
containing a hunting dagger, knife and fork; two
chased stilettoes; three poniards with hollow gilt
blades, and three chased and gilt bronze candlesticks,
all from the same collection.</p>

<p>Let us add that during the last two days of the
occupation three train wagons, which contained, it
was said, officers’ baggage, had been shunted into
the principal courtyard of the palace. The truth is
that these three wagons served merely to load and
to carry away valuable articles taken by the soldiers
and non-commissioned officers from the houses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Compiègne. The house of M. Orsetti, in front of the
palace, was completely looted in this way.</p>

<h3>Looting of Châteaux</h3>

<p>All the fine old châteaux of the Champagne and Marne
region, and all the rich estates and villas situate in
that part of Lorraine which has been invaded, were
also pillaged and sacked. The ironwork of the
fourteenth and fifteenth century, the Gothic wainscoting,
the antique furniture, were taken away.
Everything which was supposed to have any value—jewels,
silver, <i>objets d’art</i>, books—was stolen.</p>

<p>At the Moulinot Priory, the property of M. de
Chauffault, and at Raon-l’Etape, where the 99th
infantry regiment (to which Renter and Forstner,
heroes of the celebrated incidents of Saverne, belonged),
the 50th line regiment and the Baden reservists
carried out a general pillage, and took away furniture,
pianos, libraries, amateur collections, clocks, pictures,
and brought them to the railway station, where a train
under full steam was ready to take them to Germany.
It was Prussian and Baden officers who, in the majority
of cases, accompanied by their wives, chose, took, stole
or destroyed, defiled or smashed everything, according
as the article which they were examining could be
removed or not.</p>

<p>Near the town of Meaux and some hundreds of metres
from the village of Congis is the château of Gné. At
the beginning of the battle of the Marne the German
general staff was installed there. Of this château
there remained, after the vandals had passed by, only
the ruins. The chests-of-drawers were broken, the
beautiful tapestries defiled, the armchairs smashed
to pieces, the costly pictures slashed, even the linen
of the château stolen. When the allied troops forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the Germans back and reoccupied it, only wounded
were found in it, who, before the arrival of the conquerors,
had taken care to ransack the whole house and
to finish the work of destruction which had been begun.</p>

<p>We repeat that these outrages were the work of
officers no less than of soldiers. And it was a captain
who led the Germans at Creil when they burst into the
houses of rich owners, broke the doors and windows,
and gave themselves up to pillage.</p>

<p>The same kinds of acts were also committed by the
Germans in Alsace. The case of Cernay, where the
Germans drove out the inhabitants in the month of
January, is an example. All these people had to leave
the town at three o’clock in the morning. A manufacturer
of the country who returned to his villa at
7.15, found a detachment of German soldiers engaged
in taking down the pictures from the walls and packing
up articles which they could not carry. When he
expressed his surprise at seeing them appropriating
his property, the soldiers replied that they were acting
under the orders of their superiors.</p>

<h3>Robbing the Dead and Wounded</h3>

<p>The universally admitted obligation not to plunder
an enemy who has fallen on the field of battle has
been, like so many others, repudiated by the Germans.
The personal belongings, silver, jewels, etc., of the dead
and wounded have been not merely coveted, but
actually plundered by them. Examples of this infamous
conduct were numerous, chiefly on the battlefields
of France.</p>

<p>On the 8th August, on the spot where a small
cavalry engagement had taken place, at Beuveille
(in Champagne), a French lieutenant of dragoons, who
was wounded and lying unconscious on the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
was robbed (for his own account of the incident see
the <i>Matin</i> of the 22nd August, 1914) of a sum of
250 francs in gold by the leader of a German platoon,
M. de Schaffenberg, of the Trèves light infantry.
His orderly, a dragoon, also wounded, lying a few paces
away from the French lieutenant, was robbed of some
money that he had by the same German officer. A
French hussar who was attended by Dr. Weiss at the
Nancy hospital told this doctor that he had broken
his leg by falling from his horse, and that, as he was
lying under his mount, he was attacked by Uhlans, who
robbed him of his watch and chain.</p>

<p>Similar cases were so frequent that the French
troops scarcely wondered when they captured, near
Senlis, a horseman of the German imperial guard,
accompanied by three German subjects who spoke
French very well, and as they knew the district served
him as guide and accomplices in the work of brigandage
in which he engaged. The numerous articles which
they found in the pockets of these wretches left no
doubt on this point: they were, therefore, brought
before a court-martial at the same time as several other
German prisoners who had been guilty of similar thefts;
in particular, a Death’s-head hussar, who had been
found in possession of a roll of bills stolen in Belgium,
a considerable sum of French gold, and many jewels.</p>

<h3>Enormous Taxes levied by the Germans</h3>

<p>The taxes levied by the Germans in several towns of
Belgium and France were represented by the invaders
as either fines or war contributions. If, however, we
consider them a little more closely, we shall not be
able to see anything in them but theft, admitted and
official. It is a consequence and an extension of
thefts committed on the field of battle. That such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
levies should be permitted, they must be represented
as expenses arising out of invasion. It is within such
limits only that international law recognises war
levies. Such as it is, we have no doubt that this limit is
stretched to some extent. Collective fines imposed for
damage sustained by an invading army are manifestly
a mockery. No less ridiculous is the claim to make up
for the general expenses of war by levies of this kind.</p>

<p>The Germans had no hesitation in using these two
pretexts as an excuse. Moreover, it is plain that
in their view a war tax would come under the head of
the system in reliance on which war makes everything
permissible. In several places these levies were,
practically speaking, represented as a ransom for invaded
towns. It seemed that these towns had to pay
for the favour done them of not being handed over
to pillage. If they came and refused the money,
because they did not know where to find it, at once
the German commandant threatened them with fire,
devastation and pillage. These levies, therefore, were
reckoned in the category of methods of terrorisation.
Their aim was to make the inhabitants desire peace
by multiplying their sufferings.</p>

<p>As for openly admitted reasons, the following are
taken from an article in the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>, which
dealt with the levy imposed on Belgium and the city
of Brussels and, on the other hand, from a proclamation
of Lieutenant-general Nieber, with regard to a
tax levied on the town of Wavre.</p>

<p>“The war tribute imposed on Belgium,” wrote the
<i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>, “<i>was a punishment for ill-treatment
of the Germans in Belgium</i>. We are now at Brussels,
where not more than a fortnight ago some Germans,
quietly going on with their work in a foreign country,
were abandoned to the cruelty of the mob. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
happened then will be a perpetual stain on the honour
of the Belgian people.</p>

<p>“We have asked ourselves what might be demanded
as <i>reasonable compensation for the inhuman treatment
inflicted on our compatriots</i>, and it appears it is impossible,
save by legal means, to punish those who
have committed such acts.</p>

<p>“But another measure is possible and recognised
by international law, and that is why we have imposed
a very high war tax on the town of Brussels.</p>

<p>“This <i>town must bear the whole weight of the legally
recognised expenses of war</i>, to wit: the quartering of
the troops, and the supply of all the provisions needed
by our army up to the point when <i>all the resources of
the town are exhausted</i>, and its inhabitants have begun
to realise individually and as a whole that the baiting
of defenceless women is not at all the same thing as
the occupation of their houses by the enemy. Whatever
it be, the punishment inflicted on the Belgians
for the offences of which they have been guilty will
be inflicted with all the rigour permitted by the law.”</p>

<p>As regards the tax levied on the town of Wavre,
Lieutenant-general Nieber writes on the 27th August,
in a letter to the mayor—</p>

<p>“On the 22nd August, 1914, General von Bülow,
in command of the second army, imposed on the town
of Wavre a war-levy of 3,000,000 francs, payable on
the 1st September, <i>as punishment for a surprise attack
on the German troops, conduct for which no name is too
bad, and which was contrary to international law and
the usages of war</i>.</p>

<p>“The general in command of the second army has
just instructed the general in charge of the depot of
the second army to collect the aforesaid levy without
delay, <i>which the town must pay for its conduct</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“I command and instruct you to hand over to the
bearer of the present note the first two instalments,
being 2,000,000 francs in gold. I require you also to
give the bearer a letter, duly sealed with the town seal,
declaring that the balance of 1,000,000 francs will be
paid without fail on the 1st September. I call the
attention of the town to the fact that it will under no
circumstances be able to count upon any extension
of time, for <i>the civil population has put itself outside
the pale of international law by firing on the German
soldiers</i>. The town of Wavre will be fired and destroyed
if payment be not made in good time, without respect
of persons; the innocent will suffer with the guilty.”</p>

<h3>German Pleas in Defence, and their Validity</h3>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the principle of
holding towns to ransom is not admitted by any one
to-day. Bluntschli, the German jurist, writes on this
head a phrase which sounds ironical: “War has
become civilised…… No one has any longer the right
to pillage, and still less the right to destroy, without
military necessity; <i>therefore there can no longer be any
question of buying off this pretended right</i>.” On the
other hand, the policy of terrorisation is not admitted.
It is, however, very remarkable that the <i>Kölnische
Zeitung</i> apparently caves in to it by commenting on
the gravity of the situation in which the Belgians
were, owing to (1) the fact “<i>that their houses had been
occupied by the enemy</i>,” and (2) the exhaustion of
“<i>the whole resources of the town</i>.”</p>

<p>Article 50 of the Hague Regulations stipulates, in
fact, that no collective punishment, pecuniary or
otherwise, can be enacted against the civil population
by reason of individual acts for which they could not
collectively be held responsible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>German generals or publicists, therefore, have no
authority to set up a system of collective indemnity,
monetary or other, in punishment of individual acts,
and still less to impose these indemnities under threat
of pillaging and burning towns.</p>

<p>As for the claim to recover the costs and expenses of
war by a tax levied on the inhabitants of the invaded
territory, the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i> is shamelessly lying
when it says that such a claim is “recognised by
international law.” Not a single authority in this
sense can be quoted; on the contrary, there are express
statements of the very opposite. The well-known
Argentine writer, Calvo, declares that such a theory
involves an abuse of force, and is “in flagrant contradiction
to the principle which enacts that war is waged
against a state, and not against individuals taken separately.”
It was in conformity with this principle that the
Germans themselves, in 1870, refused to admit that the
amount of the monetary contributions previously levied
in France (thirty-nine million francs) could be deducted
from the five milliards imposed on France by the Treaty
of Frankfurt, a confirmation as clear as it is unexpected
of the principle which they are violating to-day.</p>

<h3>The Chief Examples in Belgium of this Breach
of International Law</h3>

<p>The Germans imposed on the town of Liège a payment
of ten million francs, and demanded fifty millions
from the province. The provinces of Brabant and
Brussels were assessed at 50 and 450 million francs
respectively, “as a war contribution.” Moreover,
it was declared in the note signed in the name of
General Arnim by Captain Kriegsheim, of the general
staff of the 4th army corps in presence of M. Max,
Mayor of Brussels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>At Louvain, the German authorities, represented by
the commandant, Manteuffel, demanded a payment of
100,000 francs “as a war indemnity”; after negotiation
they reduced the amount to 3000 francs. At
Tournai on the 25th August an officer entered, revolver
in hand, into the hall where the mayor and the members
of the municipal council were in conference, and, on
the plea that “civilians had fired on German soldiers,”
declared, in spite of the mayor’s protests, that if “<i>two
million francs were not sent him by 8 p.m. on the same day,
the town would be bombarded</i>.” The sum was paid, but
this did not prevent the Germans from taking as hostages
the mayor, his deputies, and the bishop, who were sent
to Ath and Brussels, where their liberty was restored
on presentation of the receipt for two million francs.</p>

<p>Antwerp fell on the 9th October. The town was
ordered to pay a war contribution which amounted to
the grotesque sum of half a milliard of marks (625
million francs).</p>

<p>From the town of Wavre the Germans demanded,
under the conditions mentioned in the letter of
Lieutenant-general Nieber, previously quoted, a sum
of three millions, which raised the total of the levies
imposed by the Germans in Belgium to 1,180,000,000
francs. By distributing this amount equally over
the Belgian population we find that each inhabitant
of this country, ravaged, burnt, pillaged, and, in short,
stripped of all its resources, was mulcted in an average
payment of 158 francs.</p>

<p>This colossal theft, though it was ordered, could
not be carried out so easily. The Mayor of Brussels
paid a first instalment of five millions of the fifty
millions imposed on the town of Brussels, and covered
another fifteen millions by municipal bonds. But
when, in the closing days of September, the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
governor of Belgium, Marshal von der Goltz, who had
been appointed in the meantime, demanded payment
of the outstanding balance of thirty millions, M. Max
informed the German authorities that the public
treasury had been transferred to Antwerp, and forbade
the banks to pay the sum demanded. The mayor was
not at all to blame for this, as the German authorities
had decided, on the pretext that payment was late,
that requisitions would not be paid for. The Germans
regarded the refusal of M. Max as a failure to keep
engagements made, and the arrest of the mayor took
place in violation of every principle of international law.</p>

<p>The <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i> of the 30th September made
it appear that the attitude of M. Max was explained
by the latter’s confidence that the Germans would soon
be defeated; moreover, this same paper postdated
the German authorities’ decision not to pay for requisitions
in order to palm it off as a reply to M. Max’s
refusal. Thus, open prevarication was added to
extortion and violence.</p>

<p>None the less, all these difficulties had the effect of
inducing the German Government to modify their
method of demanding payment. A monthly war tax
of forty million francs was substituted for all the levies
in the occupied area.</p>

<h3>Examples of the same Breach of Law in France</h3>

<p>The following is the notice which informed the
inhabitants of Lunéville of the tax in which they had
been mulcted—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On the 25th August, 1914” (runs the notice), “the
inhabitants of Lunéville made an attack by ambuscade
on German columns and trains. On the same day
the inhabitants fired on medical sections wearing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Red Cross. Moreover, they fired on German wounded,
and on the military hospital, which included a German
ambulance. <i>On account of these hostile acts a contribution
of 650,000 francs is levied on the Commune of
Lunéville.</i> The mayor was ordered to pay this sum
in gold (and in silver up to 50,000 francs) on the 6th
September at 9 a.m., into the hands of the representative
of the German military authority. Any objection
will be considered null and void. No delay will be
allowed. If the commune does not punctually carry
out the order to pay the sum of 650,000 francs <i>all the
property that can be requisitioned will be seized. In
case of non-payment, a house-to-house investigation will
be made and all the inhabitants will be searched. Whoever
knowingly conceals money, or tries to secure his
property from being seized by the military authority,
or who tries to leave the town, will be shot.</i> The mayor
and hostages taken by the military authority will be
held responsible for the exact carrying out of the orders
given herewith. The mayor’s staff are ordered to make
known these instructions at once to the Commune.</p>

<p class="right">“Commandant-in-Chief <span class="smcap">von Fosbender</span>.</p>

<p>“Hénaménil, 3rd September, 1914.”</p>

</div>

<p>“A perusal of this ineffable document,” says the
Report of the French Commission, “entitles one to
ask whether the arson and murder committed at
Lunéville on the 25th and 26th August by an army
which was not acting under the excitement of battle, and
which had refrained from killing during the previous
days, were not deliberately ordered for the purpose of
adding verisimilitude to an allegation which was to
serve as a pretext for the demand for an indemnity.”</p>

<p>The town of Lille was mulcted in a contribution
of ten millions; Roubaix and Tourcoing in ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
millions; Armentières in half a million; Valenciennes
in three millions. The excuse given by the Germans,
so far as Valenciennes was concerned, was that a
song, entitled “William’s Last Will and Testament,”
which was considered to be disrespectful to the Kaiser,
had been seized in the town. This justified a fine
of two millions. The third million was imposed
because the town had not supplied the quantity of
flour demanded by the German troops. The threat
was made that, if the money was not paid, the mayor,
M. Tanchon, would be shot.</p>

<p>The province of Marne was mulcted in a fine of
thirty millions, twenty-two of which were for the
town of Reims and eight for Châlons-sur-Marne. The
German commissary-general agreed to accept from
Châlons 500,000 francs merely as an instalment. The
remainder had not to be paid, as the Prince of Saxony
and his headquarters staff left Châlons three days
afterwards, followed two days subsequently by all the
German troops who were fleeing before the French.</p>

<p>Epernay had to pay 175,000 francs. But the town
came by its money again, thanks to a French surgeon,
Dr. Véron, the only one available in this district, who
demanded for the treatment he had given a German
prince the sum which the town had paid.</p>

<p>In Serbia, the Austrian troops did the same at
Losnitza, where a contribution of 100,000 dinars had to
be paid <i>to avert destruction by fire</i>. The payment of the
money, however, did not prevent hostages being taken
away, the town destroyed, and nineteen peasants shot.</p>

<h3>Requisitions</h3>

<p>In recognition of the necessities of troops in the
field, the right of requisition is allowed, but it must,
as far as possible, be exercised with moderation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Supplies must be paid for in ready money, or else must
be acknowledged by receipts, and in any case payment
must take place as soon as possible. The German
publicist, Bluntschli, even imposes on the occupying
troops the obligation to pay on delivery for supplies
for which demand is made.</p>

<p>In violation of this established principle, the Germans
have taken supplies without payment not only in
Belgium, but also in France. As they were taking
without payment their demands were unmeasured.
On several occasions the amount of their demands
was simply preposterous. Being thus forced to
denude themselves far beyond their means, the inhabitants
were a prey to famine, whilst the German
troops were gorging themselves, and even allowing
what they had taken to be lost and go bad. Under
such conditions the inhabitants found they were
compelled to take to flight.</p>

<p>At Brussels, the requisition of large quantities of
provisions was ordered. These provisions had to be
delivered on the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 23rd August,
by virtue of a note sent by Captain Kriegscheim,
acting in the name of General Sixtus Arnim, in command
of the 4th army corps, in presence of the mayor.
If these deliveries did not take place by certain fixed
times the town would be obliged to pay double the
amount, based on the market price. These large
quantities of provisions could not be used. Although
they had been scraped together by so painful efforts
they were simply squandered. Four thousand kilos
of meat had to be thrown out, as well as piles of rolls
of butter, and quantities of coffee and sugar, which
the troops were unable to consume.</p>

<p>It appears that in several cases these requisitions
were merely made as an excuse for pillage. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
way the works at Herstal, near Liège, were ordered
by the German headquarters staff to deliver 50,000
rifles and three million cartridges. Of course the
manager of the works refused. Then the German
headquarters staff assembled again the board of
administration of the company. There was a fresh
refusal, and no less energetic, to do what the enemy
demanded. The board urged the authority of the
clauses of the Hague Convention. <i>Consequently, and in
revenge for this opposition</i>, the German headquarters
staff ordered that the armouries should be pillaged.</p>

<p>At Amiens, as the town was unable to supply the
enormous quantity of provisions demanded by the
Germans, twelve inhabitants were taken as hostages,
and transferred to Clermont. There they had to
appear before a sort of court-martial, which condemned
them to pay 20,000 francs. This sum was paid by
the municipality.</p>

<p>At Epernay, 50,000 bottles of wine were requisitioned
to enable the German soldiers to get tipsy. At Antwerp,
requisitions were made of provisions which were
intended to be consumed on the spot. These provisions
were sent by rail to an unknown destination.</p>

<p>At Lille, in the month of November, the mayor was
obliged to deliver 1,500,000 francs’ worth of food
produce. On the 25th of the same month General
Heindrich warned him by official letter that Germany
could no longer meet the needs of the population, and
that if “England could not make up her mind to allow
provisions from over seas to come in for the support
of the occupied provinces of France, it would be
chiefly the French population who would have to
bear the result of this state of things.” The amount
of requisitions of food produce imposed on Lille was
so great, according to the declaration of the mayor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of Lille, dated 27th November, 1914, addressed to
General Heindrich, that “if the situation continues, the
town would suffer an absolute famine, which would
affect thousands of families, composed mainly of
women and children.”</p>

<p>General Heindrich also made some show of remedying
this state of affairs by advising the mayor of Lille
to ask for the assistance of the Swiss Government.
The mayor of Lille attempted this application on the
28th November, but the German authorities took
care not to transmit it (see the <i>Temps</i> of the 20th
December).</p>

<p>The fact that the German requisitions amounted to
pillage was recognised by the American Commission of
Relief for Belgium, which gratuitously distributed ten
to twelve million francs’ worth of provisions a month.</p>

<p>On the advice of Sir Edward Grey, Mr. Hoover,
President of this Commission, asked the German
Government to abstain from requisitioning provisions
of any kind, as otherwise American subscriptions
would have the effect of indirectly contributing to
the support of the German army, which would take
pains to pillage officially the provisions sent for poor
Belgians. The German Government replied that it
would <i>consent to refrain from requisitioning provisions
to the east of Ghent</i>. This was as much as to confess
that the German military authorities had taken away
from the inhabitants of Belgium provisions of which
they stood in need.</p>

<h3>Other Examples of Official Pillage</h3>

<p>Examples of official pillage of every kind practised
by Germany are to be had in abundance. Sometimes
it was the military authorities who shamelessly seized
the deposits in private banks. This was shown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
have taken place at Liège, Dinant, and Louvain,
where quite a large sum of money was taken from the
Bank de la Dyle and 12,000 francs from the Banque
Populaire. At Lille the savings bank was robbed.
Sometimes pillage took the form of fining newspapers.
In this way the <i>Croix du Nord</i> had to pay 150,000
francs for having described the German army in one
of its articles as “a flood of Teutons.”</p>

<p>At Châlons-sur-Marne, the German commandant
asked M. Servès, deputy mayor, “to have all the
shops in the town opened, so that the soldiers might
buy what they needed.” When M. Servès remarked
that it would be well that sentries should be stationed
before the shops, the German officer replied that it
was for the police of the town to keep order. M.
Servès replied that there were no longer any police.
Then the commandant came in in a towering rage
and shouted: “There should have been. It is not
fair that people who remain in the town should alone
have to bear the burden. Those who have fled
must bear their part. Consequently our soldiers
will be instructed to break open the doors of shops
and take what they want.” And pillage, officially
ordered, began. To mitigate the odium of it General
Seydewitz warned the town that he was reviving the
security of 500,000 francs, which had been demanded
on the first day of occupation as a guarantee for the
requisitions. But this half-million was taken again
as an instalment of the monetary contribution levied
on the town.</p>

<h3>The Chapter of German Admissions</h3>

<p>As far as concerns pillage carried on by way of
requisitions we have the evidence of proclamations,
letters, and other official communications issued by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the German authorities. In no other documents
could the chapter of admissions be so explicit.</p>

<p>As for theft and pillage committed by soldiers or
by officers in their private capacity, the following
is evidence supplied by Germans themselves.</p>

<p>A German reservist who died in France, <i>privat-docent</i>
of a university, married, and father of a family,
carefully notes in his pocket-book, which was found
by the French, the parcel he sent to his wife of jewels
which he found in an empty house. Another day he
confesses he stole a microscope. “The Frenchman”
(he wrote) “bought it in Germany, and I took it back
again.”</p>

<p>Another German soldier, Gaston Klein (1st Landsturm
company), describes the sack of Louvain in the
following terms: “At first only a few troops went
back to the town, but afterwards the battalion marched
into the town in close ranks <i>to break into the first
houses</i> to plunder—I beg pardon, to requisition—wine
and other things as well. Like a company
which had been disbanded, every one went where he
pleased. The officers went on in front and set us a
good example. One night in barracks, many men
drunk, and there the story ends. This day filled me
with a disgust which I could not describe.”</p>

<p>The Saxon officer of the 178th regiment, who
supplied us with so much precious evidence about
German crimes, writes in his pocket-book: “Herpigny-Baclan
(17th August). I visited the little château,
which belongs to a secretary of the King of the Belgians.
Our men behaved like Vandals: first they ransacked
the cellar, then they burst into the rooms and threw
everything upside down: attempts were even made
to burst open the safes; our men carried off heaps
of useless things for the mere pleasure of marauding.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“At Rethel,” continued the same officer, “the
interior of the house is charming. The furniture
was magnificent. Now everything is in pieces. <i>Vandals
could not have done more damage. The leaders of the
columns were responsible—they could have prevented
pillage and destruction. The damage may be reckoned
in millions. Safes were burst open. In an attorney’s
house a collection of old pottery and oriental</i> objets
d’art <i>was broken into a thousand pieces</i>.”</p>

<p>In spite of protests made to the German troops
and their leaders, the Saxon officer at length succumbed
to the contagion and followed their example.
“As for myself,” he naïvely writes, “I could not help
being carried away to this side and that by little
souvenirs. I found a magnificent waterproof cloak
and a photographer’s apparatus which I am going
to give to Felix.”</p>

<p>“In a village near Blamont,” writes another soldier,
Paul Spielmann, 1st company, 1st Infantry Brigade of
Guards, “<i>everything was given up to pillage</i>.”…</p>

<p>Private Handschuhmacher (11th Battalion reserve
light infantry) also writes: “8th August, 1914, Gouvy
(Belgium). The Belgians having fired on the German
soldiers, we at once began to pillage the goods station.
Some cash-boxes, eggs, shirts, and everything which
could be eaten was taken away. The safe was gutted
and the gold distributed amongst the men. As for
bank-bills they were torn up.”</p>

<p>“The enemy,” wrote another non-commissioned
officer (Hermann Levith, of the 160th regiment of infantry
7th corps), “occupied the village of Bièvre and
the outer-fringe of the wood in the rear. The third
company advanced as a first line. We took the village,
<i>then pillaged almost all the houses</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“The second battalion,” wrote a third (Schiller of the
133rd infantry, 19th corps) “entered into the village
of Haybes (Ardennes), <i>ransacked the houses and pillaged
them</i>.”…</p>

<p>One thing which must be remembered as a feature
of German character is that German doctors took
part in pillage. This is what we learn from a letter
of Private Jean Thode (4th reserve regiment): “Brussels,
5. 10. 14. A motor came up to the hospital and
brought some war booty: a piano, two sewing-machines,
many albums, and all sorts of other things.”</p>

<p>Some admissions are couched in the form of indignation.
“They do not behave like soldiers,” writes a
soldier of the 65th Landwehr infantry, “but like
highway robbers, bandits, and brigands, and they are
a disgrace to our regiment and to our army.” “<i>No
discipline</i>,” writes another, (a lieutenant of the 77th
reserve infantry); “<i>the pioneers are not much good;
as for the artillery they are a band of robbers</i>.”</p>

<p>But if this particular lieutenant blames the conduct
of his men, others, on the contrary, deliberately order
them to pillage. Like the soldier who writes at Louvain
that the officers set a good example, four other German
soldiers, named Schrick and Weber (of the 39th Prussian
infantry), Waberzech (of the 35th Brandenburg),
and Brugmann (of the 15th Mecklenburg hussars), on
whom were found a quantity of French paper money,
watches and jewels, all taken from houses in Senlis
and Chantilly, confessed before the French court-martial
that it was their officers who should have
been blamed. “If I had not taken the jewels” (said
one of them) “one of my officers would have taken
them.”… “We got from our leaders” (the others
declared) “the order to pillage the houses.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">DEGREES OF RESPONSIBILITY. CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p>At this point we shall give our conclusions. We
think it necessary to establish the degrees of responsibility
for the above attested facts: and the reader
will think it right for us to add some precise mention
of the authors of the facts. The omission of such a
chapter would have the effect of helping to keep our
indignation in the air, and thus leaving for objects
of the blame contained in it only some multitudes of
persons, amongst whom our indictment would be
diluted and dispersed. Not that we desire to take
away from the German people as such the responsibility
which attaches to them, but we desire to add some
names thereto.</p>

<p>The first responsible party whom we must mention
is the German nation, and explicitly the German
army judged by its private soldiers. It is upon the
German private soldier, indisputably, that the shame
of what we have just read recoils. It was the private
soldiers who committed the greater part of the crimes
which we have noticed: they were the principal
authors of these crimes. But it must be added that
the leaders consistently encouraged them. In several
instances they acted on explicit instructions from
officers, and even from generals.</p>

<h3>The Responsibility of the Leaders</h3>

<p>At the beginning of this book we noted the fatal
teachings of the most famous military writers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Germany, writers who formed the war-school in which
was developed the military spirit of the officers of 1914.
These teachings were theories of war carried on in
defiance of international law. The putting to death
of captured soldiers and defenceless civilians is latent
in such doctrines.</p>

<p>If, then, we wish to sum up in a word the system
practised by German officers, during the course of
a war which is still in progress, we may describe it
as the system <i>of terrorising the enemy on the plea of
military necessity</i>.</p>

<p>German officers showed themselves liberal in their
estimate of the urgency, extent, and oftener still of
the bare existence of such necessity. Therein we
find the source of so many cowardly cruelties and
crimes. “War! it is war,” they say. As the French
Commission of Inquiry observes, for all their exactions,
even for all their crimes, there was no redress; and if
any unfortunate dared to beg an officer to deign to
intervene and spare his life, or protect his property,
he received no other reply, if he was not met with
threats, than this invariable formula, accompanied
by a smile and ascribing to the inevitable disasters
of war the most cruel atrocities.</p>

<p>The German officer, therefore, has made himself
responsible for the cruelties that have been committed:
(1) either by ordering them or suggesting them to
his subalterns or his men; (2) or by himself performing
them: (3) or, finally, by tolerating them when they
were committed under his eyes, or by not punishing
the guilty when he was informed about their crime.
By acting in one of these three ways the German
officer has justified the English writer who uttered
the following judgment of the conduct of the Germans
in 1870: “The world at least is indebted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Germans for having thrown light upon war … in
which the soldier, the thief and the assassin can hardly
be distinguished” (J. A. Farrer, <i>Military Manners and
Customs</i>, chap. iv., p. 119). It is true, and we cannot
avoid saying so, that in the present war the German
officer has shown an essentially criminal mind. And
we now make this accusation, which we have established
by facts; our investigations, and the profound study
which we have made of the subject, allow us completely
to justify the declaration of the French Commission
of Inquiry, “the higher command, up to its
most exalted personalities, will bear before the world
the crushing responsibility of crimes committed by
the German army.”</p>

<h3>The Names of the Officers</h3>

<p>We shall mention here the names of the officers in
question. But we must, above all, begin with the
princes in whose name so many outrages have been
committed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. <i>The Emperor William II.</i> In a speech addressed
to his troops, on the eve of the battle of the Vistula,
the Emperor William himself uttered these words,
which form as it were the savage programme of all
the atrocities that have been committed: “Woe to
the conquered. The conqueror knows no mercy.”</p>

<p>2. <i>The Emperor Franz Joseph.</i> In an Imperial
order, which includes instructions to the Austrian
soldiers in the war against the Serbs, the Emperor
Franz Joseph depicts the latter as “moved by a
savage hatred against the Austrians. They deserve,”
(he said) “no consideration either of humanity or of
chivalry.” By the terms of this order all francs-tireurs
who were captured were to be put to death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>Prince Eitel-Frederic</i>, son of the Emperor of
Germany. The Prince stayed for eight days in a
château near Liège. The owner was present. Under
the eyes of his hosts the Prince had all the dresses
packed up which he found in the chests of the mistress
of the house and her daughters.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Duke of Brunswick.</i> The Prince took part
in the pillage of the same château, near Liège.</p>

<p>5. <i>Marshal von Hindenburg</i>, commander-in-chief of
the Imperial troops in East Prussia. This marshal
ordered that the bread found in this province, which
had been soaked with petrol, should serve as food
for Russian prisoners.</p>

<p>6. <i>Marshal von der Goltz</i>, military governor of
Belgium. In a notice signed by him and posted
up on the 5th October, 1914, at Brussels, the marshal
decreed the penalty of death against the inhabitants,
whether guilty or not, in places near which the telegraph
wires had been cut or the railway destroyed.</p>

<p>7. <i>General von Bülow</i>, commander-in-chief of the
Second German army. This general ordered the
first bombardment of Reims: on the 22nd August,
after the sack of Ardennes, he had the following
notice posted up: “It was with my consent that
the general-in-chief had the whole locality burnt and
that about a hundred persons were shot.” On the
25th August, at Namur, another proclamation from
his hand read as follows: “Belgian and French
soldiers must be given up as prisoners of war before
four o’clock, before the prison. Citizens who do not
obey will be sentenced to forced labour for life in
Germany. A strict inspection of houses will begin at
four o’clock. <i>Every soldier found will be immediately
shot.</i> Arms, powder, dynamite, must be given up
at four o’clock. <i>The penalty for default will be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
fusillade</i>. All the streets will be occupied by a German
guard, who will take ten hostages in every street. <i>If
any outbreak takes place in the street, the ten hostages
will be shot.</i>”</p>

<p>8. The Austrian <i>General Horschstein</i>, commander
of the 6th army corps operating against the Serbians.
He is the author of the following order, issued on the
14th August at Rouma: “Seeing the hostile attitude
of the inhabitants of Klenak and Chabatz, we must,
in all Serbian localities which have either been occupied
or will be occupied, take hostages who will be kept
close to our troops. <i>In cases where the inhabitants
commit any offence, or make any attack, or are guilty
of any treachery, the hostages will immediately be put
to death and the locality ravaged by fire. The headquarters
staff alone has the right to fire any locality
situate in our territory.</i> This order will be published
by the civil authorities.”</p>

<p>9. <i>General Heeringen</i>, commander of the German
army of Champagne. He continued the bombardment
of Reims, and was the cause of the destruction of the
cathedral.</p>

<p>10. <i>General Klauss</i>, was the cause of the butcheries
at Gerbeviller and Traimbois.</p>

<p>11. <i>General Forbender</i>, the author of the monstrous
and inhuman proclamation by which Lunéville found
itself mulcted in taxes.</p>

<p>12 and 13. <i>General Durach</i> and the <i>Prince of
Wittenstein</i>, commanders of the Wurtemburg troops
and Uhlans during the burning of Clermont in Argonne.</p>

<p>14. The Baden <i>General Fabricius</i>. He emptied the
cellars of Baccarat.</p>

<p>15. <i>General de Seydewitz.</i> He was present, and did
not interfere to prevent it, at the pillage of Châlons-sur-Marne,
ordered by one of his subalterns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>16. <i>General Heindrich</i>, commander of the German
troops at Lille, who, by exorbitant requisitions, reduced
the population of this town to starvation, and made
away with the appeal for help which the mayor of
Lille, on his own advice, had addressed to the President
of the Swiss Republic.</p>

<p>17. <i>General Stenger</i>, commander of a brigade in
France, who issued the well-known order of the day
giving instructions to kill the wounded and to execute
prisoners of war.</p>

<p>18. <i>Lieutenant-general Nisher.</i> He demanded of
the little town of Wavre the exorbitant war-contribution
of 3,000,000 francs, which General Bülow
had imposed. “The town of Wavre will be burnt
and destroyed if payment is not made in good time,
without respect of persons—<i>the innocent will suffer
with the guilty</i>.”</p>

<p>19. <i>General Sixtus of Arnim</i>, commander of the
4th German army corps, who mulcted the town of
Brussels and the province of Brabant in the monstrous
contribution of 500,000,000 francs.</p>

<p>20. <i>General von Bissing</i>, commander of the 7th
German army corps, who, in a proclamation to his
troops in Belgium, told them that when “civilians take
upon them to fire on us, the <i>innocent must suffer with
the guilty</i>”; that “the German authorities have on
several occasions in their instructions to the troops
said that <i>human life must not be spared in repressing
such acts</i>”; that “it is doubtless regrettable that houses,
flourishing villages, and even whole towns should
be destroyed, but this must not cause us to be carried
away by feelings of misplaced pity. <i>All that is not
worth the life of a single German soldier.</i>”</p>

<p>21. <i>General de Doehm</i>, commander of the 9th
German army corps. When an American journalist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of <i>The World</i> and Mr. Gibson, secretary of the United
States Embassy at Brussels, told him they had seen
the bodies of mutilated women and children at Louvain,
this general replied that such incidents were “<i>inevitable
in street fighting</i>.” The American journalist remarked
that a woman’s body had the feet and hands cut off;
that of an old man showed twenty-two bayonet
thrusts in the face; that an old man’s body had been
found hanging by his hands to the beams of his house,
and that he had been burnt alive by lighting a fire
underneath him. All that General de Doehm could
say was that he was not responsible.</p>

<p>22. <i>Baron Merbach</i>, who, with Prince Eitel and
the Duke of Brunswick, took part in looting a château
near Liège.</p>

<p>23. The <i>Duke of Gronau</i>. After the château of
Villers, Notre Dame, in Belgium, had been occupied
by his headquarters he himself caused the following
to be taken and sent to Germany: 146 sets of cutlery,
236 silver-gilt spoons, 3 gold watches, 9 savings-bank

ducks, evening clothes, works of art, and a quantity
of baby linen.</p>

<p>24 and 25. <i>Count Zichy</i> and <i>Baron Sardas</i>, who
presided over the pillage from the estate, château, and
farm of M. Budny, in South Prussia, of property to
the value of 100,000 roubles.</p>

<p>26. <i>Colonel Goeppel</i>, Professor at the Academy
of War in Berlin, who compelled the Lille “Croix”
to pay a sum of 150,000 francs for calling the German
army “a flood of Teutons.”</p>

<p>27. <i>Colonel Zollern</i>, commandant of the Imperial
Army at Tchenstokhova in Poland, which he ordered
to be pillaged and destroyed, in proof of which we
have the text of the following proclamation made on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
his arrival into this town: “Houses and quarters of
the town the inhabitants of which are suspected of
hostile acts towards the army will immediately be pulled
down and destroyed. Women and children will not be
allowed to leave these houses.”</p>

<p>28. <i>Lieutenant-colonel Preuster</i>, commandant at
Kalich, in Poland, who ordered the massacres and
destruction of the town.</p>

<p>29. <i>Colonel Hannapel</i>, commander of the 8th
Bavarian regiment, who gave the order to burn down

found carrying dum-dum bullets.</p>

<p>32. <i>Captain Curtins</i>, commander of the 3rd company
of the 112th German infantry regiment, who
gave the order to make no more wounded prisoners.</p>

<p>33. <i>Commandant de Schaffenberg.</i> A French lieutenant
whom he found lying wounded on the field of
battle in Louvain was robbed by him of 250 francs
in gold. The commandant threatened the wounded
man with his revolver. The French officer’s orderly,
who was lying wounded at his side, was also robbed.</p>

<p>34. <i>Major von Mehring</i>, commandant at Valenciennes,
who declared in a proclamation: “I have
destroyed the whole town. <i>The ancient town of
Vichies, a place of 5000 inhabitants, no longer exists.</i> The
houses, town hall, and church have been annihilated.”</p>

<p>35. <i>Major de Honved</i>, in command of the 22nd
Hungarian regiment, operating against the Russians.
Addressing the recruits, he said: “When you have
penetrated into Russia, <i>grant no quarter and no mercy
to old men, women, and children even if unborn</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>44. <i>Major Dreckmann.</i> In a proclamation under
date 6th September (Guvegnee, Belgium): “The life
of hostages depends on whether the inhabitants
remain peaceful under all circumstances”; and that,
if the first hostages are not replaced in forty-eight
hours by others, <i>the hostage runs the risk of death</i>, and
whoever does not obey the command “Lift your
arms!” is punishable with the penalty of death.</p>

<p>45. <i>Commandant Chrenzer</i>, of the 26th Austro-Hungarian
regiment, operating against the Serbians,
who himself massacred prisoners and peasants who
were brought to him.</p>

<p>46. <i>Commandant Reimond</i>, of the 13th Austro-Hungarian
corps, operating against the Serbians,
who authorised the massacre of twenty-four peasants,
the most part of them old folk of both sexes.</p>

<p>47 and 48. The commandants of the 11th and 4th
detachments operating against the Serbians, who

<p>54. The German officer, <i>Walter Bloem</i>, who was
entrusted with the task of making an inquiry in
Belgium (see the <i>Cologne Gazette</i> of the 10th February,
1915), and who confessed without any sense of shame
that all that had happened was part of a system, the
principle of which was that “the whole community
to which a culprit belonged must pay the penalty,
and that the innocent must suffer in their stead, not
because a crime has been committed, but in order that
a crime may not be committed again.”</p>

<p>55. <i>Lieutenant Bertich</i>, 29th Austro-Hungarian
regiment operating against the Serbs, who killed at
Lasnitza seven innocent peasants.</p>

<p>56. <i>Lieutenant Eberlein</i>, who, in the <i>Münchener
Neueste Nachrichten</i> told the story of the monstrous
treachery to which he resorted to get into Saint Dié—viz.
using civilians as a screen for his troops.</p>

</div>

<p>The above are German generals and officers whose
names are known to us. There are many others.
But the impossibility of naming them all does not
prevent us from holding up to the execration of the
civilised world, by printing their names here, those
whom the reports supplied to us have mentioned.</p>

<p>In addition to the two emperors, there are two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
marshals, four generals, six princes and nobles, five
colonels, sixteen commandants and majors, thirteen
other subaltern officers, written on the picture of
horror, which we have sketched, and of which they
and the whole of the German people are the individual
and responsible authors.</p>

<p>Is “German militarism” alone responsible? We
say <i>the German people</i>, for it would be a mistake not
to recognise as the authors of these crimes merely the
army which performed them, the officers who tolerated
them, approved them or ordered them—in a word,
only the German military element known as “militarism.”
For this militarism is in very truth the
offspring of the whole nation, as well as of causes
which have nothing military about them—to wit, the
teaching in the universities, which has been shaping
it for a hundred years.</p>

<p>The cult of force which to the German is the cult
of brutal force imposed without mercy, goes down to
the very roots of his thought. This must not be
confounded with the spirit of violence to which, at
all ages of the world, barbarian conquerors have given
way. This cult proceeds from the fact that Germany
considers herself the only nation worthy of the name,
as <i>the</i> people <i>par excellence</i> upon whom, by law of
nature, devolves the management of the modern
world, around which it is the historic and philosophic
duty of Europe to rally until absorbed in it, and until
the civilised world is only one vast Germany in fact.
When the German declares that force is superior to
right, he does not mean force in itself, any force
whatever, but his own force, which is right.</p>

<p>Such are the notions taught by the members of the
German cabinet, by its professors, by the universities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of Berlin, Munich, Halle, and Bonn for one hundred
years. Such is the teaching promulgated in Fichte’s
famous “Addresses to the German Nation,” uttered
in 1808. We shall easily understand that a nation
which incarnates in itself all law, all history, all the
future, all rational truth, all philosophic influence,
hardly needs to think of the means by which it puts
itself forward. From the relative point of view of
human interest, as from the impartial point of view
of eternal ideas, one thing alone matters and that is
that Germany should triumph, and that Germanism
should grow.</p>

<p>To this there is only need to add one point, that this
perverted refinement of thought, this sophism, grows
and is developed among a nation which is brutal
and barbarous among all others, so that the inclinations
of flesh and blood are in it ready to respond to
the suggestions of a corrupt philosophy. In Germany
the sophist unchains the beast: the man of letters
lets slip the barbarian, or, as was forcibly said by Hugo,
an old admirer of Germany, when he had become
enlightened by the sinister glare of the events of 1870,
<i>the pedant is the ally of the trooper</i>. The fusion of
these two elements, the intimate union of German
thought and of its military counterpart, welding
together the whole of the classes intermediate between
them: in a word, that is to say, the whole of Germany—all
this must not be forgotten in any just appraisement
of the foregoing events. So we see that in fact all
Germany approves the actions of which we have
just told the story, and the German intellectuals have
taken the course of identifying themselves with them
in their well-known but shameful “appeal to the
civilised world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The <i>theoretic responsibility</i> for German cruelties,
therefore, falls upon the military writers of Germany
directly; but fundamentally, and probing more deeply,
upon her professors, historians, and philosophers.
Then come the heads of the army, who were the first
to carry out these teachings.</p>

<p>But the <i>verdict of mankind</i> condemns the whole of
Germany; for all her citizens, from the highest to
lowest, appear in the eyes of the world, which was at
first amazed and then indignant, as identifying themselves
with the work of devastation, murder, pillage,
and cowardice by which, in the judgment of history,
the war that Germany launched upon the world will
be noted.</p>

<p>We, at least, who are neutral of nationality and
impartial in judgment, lump them all together, in the
feeling of contempt and of disgust which they have
roused in our indignant breast, and in the stern but
just judgment which our reason, bitterly disappointed
as it has been, has meted out to them.</p>
